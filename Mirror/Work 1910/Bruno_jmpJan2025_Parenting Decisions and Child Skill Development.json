Each parenting style influences child skill development through two channels, they augment child study time decisions, and have a direct (potentially negative) impact on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. I use the estimated model parameters to show that an authoritative parenting style is best at increasing child cognitive and non-cognitive skills, while a permissive parenting style is typically the worst.

Children decide how much of their time they allocate towards studying and leisure.

The additional benefit of the PSID is that it is a long panel, therefore, I am able to understand the dynamics of parenting style decisions over a long time horizon."

Weinberg (2001) presents a theoretical model to explain why the use of corporal punishment is more common among low-income households. The thought is that low income households are financially constrained, making it difficult to motivate children to exert effort using an allowance, and they must resort toward punishing the undesirable outcome instead of rewarding the positive outcome. This framework is static, and is unable to state the dynamic effects of corporal punishment on child development. Galiani et al. (2017) propose a theoretical framework to explain the reduction in the use of punishment of children over the course of the 20 th century. Their model predicts that a decrease in parental income inequality and a reduction in the number of children in the household shifts the balance of power within homes, which results in a decrease in the use of corporal punishment. Burton et al. (2002) present a model of parental praise of a child's good behavior, and show that children act out more often in poor households. The main takeaway is that child behavior is influenced by a range of socioeconomic factors, but, socioeconomic factors indirectly affect parenting practices through their response to child behavior. Closely related to the result in Burton et al. (2002) is the conclusion Harris (2024) arrives at, which is that disadvantaged parents will implement harsher discipline practices as a rational response to raising their children in a more hazardous environment. Kim (2019) analyzes the parentchild relationship using a signaling model, where the signaling method used by the parent is punishment. He shows that when the parent uses consistent punishment to signal poor behavior, the child will eventually be persuaded to behave optimally even when parents do not supervise their child. Finally, Akabayashi (2006) presents a theoretical model of parental praise and punishment and child effort. Here, effort is unobserved, and Abakayashi presents conditions such that if parents overestimate their child's abilities, maltreatment of children can arise as the household equilibrium.",

The channel that is not directly in her model, is that when mothers enter the labor market, they are not with their children, and this time is productive for skill development. Del Boca et al.

I extend these models by incorporating the choice of parenting style into a model of time allocation, by allowing children to have an active role in their skill development, and by allowing for both direct and indirect effects of the choice of parenting style on the cognitive and non-cognitive skill development of children.",

Typically, those who use the PSID-CDS data to study child skill development impose a functional form on the marginal products of the child skill production functions that restricts the monotonicity and sign of the parameters. I do not take this approach, and instead follow Mullins (2022), Ronda (2017), and Cunha et al. (2010), and assume there are two development stages: (1) ages 4-9 (early childhood) and (2) ages 10-16 (middle/late childhood). This assumption allows me to estimate the marginal products of parent and child choices without the use of functional form or sign restrictions, allowing for potential negative effects of certain investment choices on the development of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. As an example, the marginal product of the mother's time investment on the production of cognitive skills, \u03b4 m t , takes two values, \u03b4 m 1 when the child is between 4 and 9 years old and \u03b4 m 2 when the child is between 10 and 16 years old. The only exception are the marginal effects of authoritarian and authoritative parenting style choices on cognitive and non-cognitive skills, ( \u03b4 ps t , \u03d5 ps t ), which I assume are constant across childhood (the marginal effect of a permissive parenting style is normalized to 0). Some may have concerns that marginal products for parent time investment are not a function of parental education, however, using the PSIDCDS data, Caucutt et al. (2020) show that parent education has little effect on the child cognitive skill production technology and, using different data, Fiorini and Keane (2014) show that parental education has little effect on the production of non-cognitive skills, therefore, I do not differentiate in the productivity of parent investment time based on education, which allows me to conserve on the number of parameters being estimated.",

The result that an authoritarian parenting style has a negative direct effect on cognitive skills replicates the result found in Agostinelli et al. (2023). What is interesting is that the negative direct effect of authoritarian parenting on child skills is slightly larger for cognitive skills than non-cognitive skills, however, recall that the total effect of a non-permissive parenting style must also take into account how the parenting style influences child study time, and the marginal effect study time has on cognitive and non-cognitive skill development. The fact that the marginal product of child study time on non-cognitive skills is negative during the first development period implies that the total effect of authoritarian parenting on non-cognitive skills is lower than the total effect on cognitive skills. These results also highlight the channel explained in other social science disciplines with respect to authoritarian and authoritative parenting. Authoritarian parenting is negatively associated with child skill development due to its demand for control and correlation with the use of corporal punishment and these negative effects are captured by my estimates, as I report that the marginal effect of being authoritarian (relative to permissive) is negative for both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Further, authoritative parenting is typically considered the best parenting style because of its association with well-defined rules and parental warmth, this is captured by my estimates because the marginal effects of authoritative parenting (relative to permissive parenting) is positive for both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Combining these with the results in Table 8, it follows that authoritarian parenting is defined by greater parental control through increased studying, but has negative direct effects through its lack of warmth and care, while authoritative parenting is defined by producing child skills through warmth and care, not through increasing time investment. The result that authoritarian parenting acts to constrain child choices while authoritative parenting acts more through skill production is an analogue to the result predicted in Doepke and Zilibotti (2017), who assume that an authoritarian parenting style constrains the child's choices, but an authoritative style molds the child's preferences.",

This is likely driven by the large change in the productivity of maternal time investment from the first and second development periods. The marginal product of maternal time investment for child cognitive skills decreases from 0.207 in the first development period to 0.077 in the second, and the marginal product for non-cognitive skills drops from 0.019 in the first development period to 0.001 in the second.

Further, child study time has a negative impact on non-cognitive skills during the first development period. One can see that while the authoritative experiment does not increase study time as much as the authoritarian experiment, the other positive practices associated with an authoritative parenting style (captured by \u03b4 AT , \u03d5 AT in the production functions), and not forcing children to study as much in the first development period ( \u03c9 1 ( AR ) < \u03c9 1 ( AT )) are the driving forces behind the improvement in average cognitive skills for children when parents are forced to be authoritative. Therefore, despite an authoritative parenting style being less effective at increasing child study time, the total marginal effect compounded over childhood is still a net improvement for child cognitive skills on average. The opposite is true for an authoritarian parenting style, as the negative direct effects on both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, plus, the extra time children spend studying in the first development period being unproductive for non-cognitive skills, ends up reducing the average cognitive skills of children. The result that forcing parents to be permissive reduces average cognitive skills the most is driven by an authoritarian style at least having the benefit of increasing study time, which is beneficial for cognitive skills in both development stages, and improves non-cognitive skills in the second development stage.",

The only scenario where parents are better off on average is when they are forced to be authoritative each period, this is likely driven by the increases in the cognitive and non-cognitive skills of their children outweighing the effort costs over time. Parent welfare is lowest on average when parents are forced to be permissive, which is the case where terminal skills are the lowest on average, this suggests that the reduction in child skills outweighs the flow utility cost of choosing an authoritarian style. Child welfare improves on average in the authoritative and permissive case, but is lower when their parents are forced to be authoritarian. The improvement in child welfare relative to baseline when parents are forced to be permissive stems from children having full autonomy to make their own decisions and thus benefiting from increases in their leisure time. The gain in welfare to children when parents are forced to be authoritative is the combination of increases in cognitive and non-cognitive skills through the direct impact of authoritative parenting, and, that an authoritative parenting style does not reduce the value the child places on leisure far from what it would be if their parents chose to be permissive. Authoritarian parenting has negative direct effects on both cognitive and noncognitive skills on top of reducing the value of child leisure time, driving the result that on average, children are worse off when their parents are forced to be authoritarian. The findings here indicate that parents' and children's welfare improves (on average) when parents are forced to be authoritative, indicating that if there was a way to ensure that parents adopted an authoritative parenting style, it would be a pareto improvement for some households.",

Parent welfare is lowest on average when parents are forced to be permissive, which is the case where terminal skills are the lowest on average, this suggests that the reduction in child skills outweighs the flow utility cost of choosing an authoritarian style. Child welfare improves on average in the authoritative and permissive case, but is lower when their parents are forced to be authoritarian. The improvement in child welfare relative to baseline when parents are forced to be permissive stems from children having full autonomy to make their own decisions and thus benefiting from increases in their leisure time. The gain in welfare to children when parents are forced to be authoritative is the combination of increases in cognitive and non-cognitive skills through the direct impact of authoritative parenting, and, that an authoritative parenting style does not reduce the value the child places on leisure far from what it would be if their parents chose to be permissive. Authoritarian parenting has negative direct effects on both cognitive and noncognitive skills on top of reducing the value of child leisure time, driving the result that on average, children are worse off when their parents are forced to be authoritarian. The findings here indicate that parents' and children's welfare improves (on average) when parents are forced to be authoritative, indicating that if there was a way to ensure that parents adopted an authoritative parenting style, it would be a pareto improvement for some households."

The analysis is complicated because the preferences of the parents are represented by a single utility function, and because children do not value income.

As the child's preference for leisure time approaches 1 (implying they do not care about their skills), the effect of the authoritarian and permissive experiment results in a larger reduction in skills. For permissive parenting, this is obvious, children do not value their skills, so in equilibrium it is likely their parents will adopt a parenting style that increases their study time, improving cognitive skills. If left to their own devices they will not study, causing the decrease in cognitive skill. The opposite is true for authoritarian parenting, while this style increases study time, it will not be by a large amount due to the friction present in the household. Children place such a low value on their skills that the gains to cognitive skills through increased study time do not outweigh the direct negative effects the parenting style has on both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. When analyzing the result for authoritative parenting, it appears the gains to cognitive skills are increasing the less the child cares about their skills. This is due to the positive direct effects of authoritative parenting on child skills, without the large negative indirect effect through increased child study time (recall an authoritative parenting style does not increase child study time as much as an authoritarian style all else equal) in the first development stage. There is still heterogeneity, suggesting that skill evolution still depends on the relative preference differences between parents and children, and the other dimensions of heterogeneity discussed above.",

      "orig": "Doepke et al. (2019) provide a methodology to map observed data in the CDS to the parenting styles defined by Baurmind (1967). While it is sensible that authoritarian parents value obedience, distinguishing between authoritative and permissive parenting in the data is slightly more difficult. In the framework presented in this paper, it is rational to define parents as authoritative if they value hard work, as this is a model of time investment, however, one would hope that the data is able to back up the methodology. Baurmind (1967) describes authoritarian and permissive parenting as the styles at the two extremes, with authoritarian parenting being the style associated with parental control and demand for obedience, while permissive parenting is characterized by allowing children to make their own choices with little interference. Baurmind describes authoritative parenting as an intermediary style that falls between the two extremes, parents still set limits and intervene when their child's behavior does not align with their desired actions, however, the enforcement of rules and punishment of rule breaking is not as punitive as an authoritarian parenting style.
