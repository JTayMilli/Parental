Introduction


This codebook provides comprehensive information on a subset of variables from the PSID
Main Interview that are available through the CDS-TAS Data Center. These variables include
information about children, young adults, and families that is not collected as part of the CDS
and TAS interviews, including sample design and demographic and household characteristics.


The goal of providing these curated variables in the CDS-TAS Data Center is to simplify the
process for data users to obtain these commonly used and important variables from the Main
PSID interview. Data users may also select these or other variables from the PSID Main
interview through the PSID Data Center and merge them with extracts created in the CDS-TAS
Data Center. We welcome suggestions for additional variables from the PSID Main Interview to
include in this curated set.


Overview of Design and Contents


The curated variables from the PSID Main Interview cover the period from 1984 to the most
recently released wave. The initial year of 1984 corresponds to the birth year of the oldest child
in the original CDS. Hence, these variables characterize observed circumstances from birth to
the most recent wave for all CDS and TAS participants. Note that PSID Main Interview variables
are available annually from 1984 through 1997 and biennially thereafter, matching the
periodicity of the PSID Main Interview.


Three types of variables are available in the file: static or summary variables, which are timeinvariant characteristics of individuals; dynamic individual-level variables, which can take
different values at each wave to describe characteristics of individuals that change over time;
and dynamic family-level variables, which can take different values at each wave to describe
changing characteristics of families.


The static variables are described in Table 1, along with notes for certain variables explaining
their inclusion and use with the CDS and TAS samples. The first two variables, the stratum and
cluster for sampling of the household of origin for the CDS and TAS sample members, may be
used to properly account for clustering of the observations when calculating standard errors
using common statistical software such as Stata and SAS.

**Table 1. Static/Summary Curated Variables in PSID Main Interview Extract**
**for CDS** **and TAS**

|Variable Description|Notes|
|---|---|
|~~Stratum~~<br>|~~Use to control for sample design~~<br>|
|~~Cluster~~<br>|~~Use to control for sample design~~<br>|
|~~Sex~~<br>|~~CDS and TAS do not include variables describing participant’s~~<br>reported sex; add this information from the curated variable set.|
|~~Mother’s marital status at birth~~<br>||
|~~Whether original sample/born~~<br>in/moved in<br>|~~See below for a description of PSID sample status.~~|
|~~Whether ever moved out of family unit~~<br>or died<br>||
|~~Whether Sample or Nonsample~~<br>|~~Sample members are individuals who were present in a PSID~~<br>family unit at the time of sample recruitment or are descended<br>from an original family unit member through birth or adoption.<br>CDS children and TAS participants are sample members. People<br>who joined a PSID family through an event like cohabitation or<br>marriage and who lack a lineal relationship to a PSID sample<br>member are “nonsample” participants in PSID. Some CDS<br>primary caregivers are nonsample.|
|~~Year of most recent nonresponse~~||



Dynamic individual-level variables are described in Table 2. These variables describe timevarying characteristics of the target child in CDS or young adult in TAS and of the CDS child’s
primary caregiver.


**Table 2. Dynamic Individual-Level Variables in PSID Main Interview Extract**
**for CDS** **and TAS**

|Variable Description|Notes|
|---|---|
|~~Family interview number~~<br>|~~A unique family-level identifier within each survey wave. The~~<br>value of this variable is_not constant_ across waves for any<br>individual. It should not be used as a merging variable.<br>|
|~~Sequence number~~<br>|~~Functions as a roster number within a family interview. Values 0,~~<br>1, and 50-89 are special values; review the codebook.<br>|
|~~Relationship to reference person~~<br>|~~Before 2015 this is referred to as ‘relationship to head’~~|
|~~Age in years~~<br>||
|~~Birth Month~~<br>|~~Birth month and birth year are included as dynamic variables.~~<br>Values may change between waves when a respondent<br>provides new information. (Such changes are infrequent.)|
|~~Birth Year~~<br>||
|~~Completed education~~<br>||
|~~Type of individual record~~<br>|~~Combines information about age, sample status, and presence~~<br>in a PSID family unit at interview.|
|~~Why nonresponse~~<br>||
|~~CDS 1997 cohort result of interview~~<br>attempt<br>|~~Use this variable to identify children who participated in the~~<br>original CDS (1997-2007)<br>|
|~~Ongoing CDS completed case~~|~~Use these variables to identify children who participated in the~~<br>ongoing CDS (2014+)|



Finally, in Table 3 we list the dynamic family-level variables from the PSID Main Interview.
These variables describe the collective family unit as well as characteristics of the Reference
Person (RP) and Spouse/Partner (S/P) of the family in which the CDS/TAS subject resides at


2


each wave. (Note that variable labels from interview years prior to 2015 will refer to the
Reference Person as the Head.)

Obtaining Additional Variables from the PSID Main Interview

Users wishing to include additional variables from the PSID Main Interview in a data extract may
visit the main PSID Data Center.

We recommend that users add PSID Main Interview variables to an existing shopping cart.
Shopping carts created by registered users in the CDS-TAS Data Center are accessible from
the PSID Data Center. To access, log in from the main page at the PSID Data Center
[(https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu). From the menu bar, select Data  Data Center  Previous](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/)
Carts. Locate and add new variables through any of the options available in the Data Center. All
data included in the CDS/TAS Data Center are also available in the PSID Data Center.

Alternatively, users may wish to create a separate data extract in the PSID Data Center and
merge that to a file or set of files previously downloaded from the CDS-TAS Data Center. If so,
[review the video tutorial](https://youtu.be/sYMr6YYhK_w) available from the PSID Data Center Documentation page on how to
merge records.

ER30001  "1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER "

1968 Interview Number (1968 ID Number)

This variable is the 1968 family ID number. The combination of this variable and Person Number (ER30002)
provides unique identification for each individual on the data file. Individuals associated with families from
the Latino and Immigrant samples, added to the PSID in 1990/1992 and 1997/1999, and 2017 respectively, were
assigned 1968 IDs so that they, too, have unique identifiers compatible with the PSID structure for the core
(SRC and Census) sample.

ER31996  "SAMPLING ERROR STRATUM "

Sampling Error Stratum

This is the stratum code required for complex variance estimation that takes the stratified multistage sample
design into account through the Taylor Series Linearization or Repeated Replication (Jackknife or Balanced
Repeated Replication) methods. This variable and ER31997 are needed to correctly compute variance estimates for
all types of PSID analyses. See the PSID technical document "Sampling Error Estimation in Design-based Analysis
of the PSID" on the PSID website for details.

  Codes

        1 - 32 Core sample stratum code

        88 - 94 Immigrant 17 sample stratum code

ER31997  "SAMPLING ERROR CLUSTER "

Sampling Error Cluster

This variable defines pairs of units within each stratum (ER31996), and is needed for computing sampling errors
using the Taylor Series Linearization or Repeated Replication (Jackknife or Balanced Repeated Replication)
methods. This variable should be used in conjunction with ER31996. See the PSID technical document "Sampling
Error Estimation in Design-based Analysis of the PSID" on the PSID website for details.

ER32003  "WTR ORIGINAL SAMPLE/BORN IN/MOVED IN  "

Whether Individual Was Born or Moved into the Panel Subsequent to the First Year of Interviewing

This variable is generated by selecting only those individuals whose person numbers are in the range 030-226,
indicating birth or move in, or whose 1968 (for core--1968 ID number=0001-2930, 5001-6872), 1990 (for most
Latinos--1968 ID number=7001-9043) or 1997/1999 for 97 Immigrants--1968 ID number=3001-3511 or 2017 for 17
Immigrants--1968 ID number=4001-4462) data values contain only zeroes because, although in the family in that
year, they were inadvertently omitted from the family listing. Such individuals were assigned original sample
person numbers (001-019). These individuals may have appeared in the panel at any time subsequent to the initial
year of interviewing (1968/1990/1997/1999/2017). Individuals associated with Latino recontact families that were
never interviewed until 1992 are included in code 4 below.

  Codes

           0 In 1968, this core individual was present or was a spouse who had died or moved
            out, and the data for 1968 are nonzero

           1 This core individual was born or moved into a panel family after 1968 and
            therefore has zero data for 1968; subsequent years' data may also contain zeroes.

           2 This core individual was missed in error in 1968, although an original sample
            member; 1968 and possibly subsequent data contain zeroes.

           3 In 1990, this Latino individual was present, or was a spouse who had died or
            moved out; the data for 1990 are nonzero.

           4 This Latino individual was born or moved into a panel family after 1990 and
            therefore has zero data for 1990; subsequent years' data may also contain zeroes.
            Latino recontacts (ER30001=9044-9308) are included here.

           5 This Latino individual was missed in error in 1990, although an original sample
            member; 1990 and possibly subsequent data contain zeroes.

           6 In 1997/1999, this 97/99 Immigrant individual was present, or was a spouse who
            had died or moved out; the data for 1997/1999 are nonzero.

           7 This 97/99 Immigrant individual was born or moved into a panel family after
            1997/1999 and therefore has zero data for that wave; subsequent years' data may
            also contain zeroes.

           8 This 97/99 Immigrant individual was missed in error in 1997/1999, although an
            original sample member; the initial, and possibly subsequent, wave of data
            contains zeroes.

           9 In 2017, this 17 Immigrant individual was present, or was a spouse who had died
            or moved out; the data for 2017 are nonzero.

           10 This 17 Immigrant individual was born or moved into a panel family after 2017 and
            therefore has zero data for that wave; subsequent years' data may also contain

            zeroes.

           11 This 17 Immigrant individual was missed in error in 2017, although an original
            sample member; the initial, and possibly subsequent, wave of data contains

            zeroes.

           12 This individual was in an institution in 1968 if core, in 1990 if Latino, in
            1997/1999 if 97/99 Immigrant, or 2017 if 17 Immigrant, (ER30002=020-029)

ER32004  "WTR EVER MOVED OUT OF FU OR DIED    "

Whether Individual Moved Out of a Responding Panel Family or Institution or is Deceased

This variable is generated by selecting individuals whose values for the Reason for Non-Response variables have
ever been 41, including those with Sequence Numbers in the range 81-89 (mover-out deceased). Also included are
those who moved out of a responding family or institution but did not join another in that same wave (mover-out
non-response). Additionally, because Person Number (ER30002) was a proxy for Sequence Number in the 1968 wave,
those core sample spouses who moved out or died in the year prior to that interview, i.e., whose person numbers
equal 227 or 228, are included. Note the separate codes 2 and 3 for the mover-out deceased versus other
deceased persons, respectively.

If any movers-out had income during the year preceding their move, this income is included in the family-level
data of the family whence they departed for the portion of the year that they were resident in that family.

  Codes

           0 This individual has never moved out of a responding family or institution and has
            never been marked as deceased

           1 This individual moved out of a responding main family or institution, was not
            included in another responding family in that wave, and has never been marked as
            deceased.

           2 This individual died while connected with a responding main family.

           3 This individual died but not while connected to a responding main family.

ER32006  "WHETHER SAMPLE OR NONSAMPLE "

Whether Individual Is Sample

This variable not only indicates persons who were sample members but also flags nonsample members who were
designated as followable. Thus far in PSID history, two such nonsample groups exist: nonsample elderly
individuals, followed from 1990 through 1995, and nonsample parents of sample children if the children were
under age 18, followed from 1994 through 2003.

Initially, the nonsample elderly have person numbers of 170 and higher and were aged 64 or older at the time of
the 1989 interview and expected to be at least age 65 by the time of the 1990 interview. In each subsequent wave
through 1995, a nonsample individual who was expected to be at least 65 years old by the time of the next
interview was added to the group. Refer to Section I, Part 1, of the Guides to the 1990 and subsequent codebooks
for further details.

Nonsample parents also have person numbers of 170 or greater. Initially, all such parents were designated in
advance of the 1994 interview if any of their sample children were under age 18. These parents were followed
until the youngest sample child reached age 25. As births of new sample members occurred from 1994 through 2003,
their nonsample parent was made followable.

Beginning in 1994, children who were born since the initial interview for the sample to which they belonged and
who carried the "PSID gene", that is, who had at least one sample parent but who did not move into a responding
PSID family at birth, were designated moved-in sample members. Such children were assigned person numbers of 170
and higher but have individual weights for years when they are present in the PSID and otherwise fall under all
PSID rules for sample members.

ER32007  "YEAR OF MOST RECENT NONRESPONSE     "

Most Recent Year of Nonresponse, Including Institutionalized Individuals

The most recent year of nonresponse is coded here. All individuals who are currently nonresponse have code
values of 2017 here. Individuals who became nonresponse in 1972, for example, but returned to a responding FU
in, say, 1990, have values of 1990 for this variable and values of 1972 for ER32008. The term "nonresponse" here
includes those individuals who have moved to institutions, are not followed for interview, but who are tracked
until the time when they set up their own households.

Note that values for main Latino sample individuals (ER30001=7001-9043) are only calculated for years when the
Latino sample was active, that is, 1990 through 1995. Nonresponse individuals from the Latino recontact sample
(ER30001=9044-9308) can have values in the range 1992-1995.

Similarly, values for 97 Immigrant sample individuals begin with 1997. Those from the 1999 sample addition
(ER30001=3442-3511) begin at 1999.

Values for the 17 Immigrant sample (ER30001=4001-4462) individuals begin with 2017.

V11080   "CENSUS NEEDS STANDARD-1983       "

Annual Needs Standard for the 1983 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/index.html. We have used the table entitled 'Poverty thresholds
by Size of Family and Number of Children'

The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. Due to some of the limitations of our extant files, we were unable to generate the number of
months for those individuals who moved out of multiple families in the same wave. Otherwise the calculation of
needs is similar to that described in Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF.

1984 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1983 Head for any individual whose 1984 sequence number (ER30430)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1983 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1984 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1984 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

V12443   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting one 1985 ID number (V11102), the lowest value, from
among the 1985 ID numbers (V11102) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data on this variable,
the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did not share
their households with other panel families were given their own values for V11102. Thus, the range of values is
0001-7032, but the series is not contiguous.

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/index.html. We have used the table entitled 'Poverty thresholds
by Size of Family and Number of Children'

The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. Due to some of the limitations of our extant files, we were unable to generate the number of
months for those individuals who moved out of multiple families in the same wave. Otherwise the calculation of
needs is similar to that described in Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF.

10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1985 interview.

This variable contains values for 1985 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1985 family-level data. For 1985 Heads,
these were computed as follows: if V11959 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the
value for V11959. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V11945 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V11948 plus V11953. Education was asked for all Heads in 1985. Wives/"Wives were
treated similarly: if V12314 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V12314.
For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V12300 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education
equals V12303 plus V12308. Education was asked for all Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

Type of Individual Data Record in 1985

All individuals who became main family nonresponse in 1985 have 1985 ID numbers equal to 0000 and zero data
values for 1985, but have nonzero data values for their 1984 records. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 1985
have nonzero data for 1985 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 1985 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are
reserved for mover-out nonresponse.

V13682   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting one 1986 ID number (V12502), the lowest value, from
among the 1986 ID numbers (V12502) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data on this variable,
the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did not share
their households with other panel families were given their own values for V12502. Thus, the range of values is
0001-7018, but the series is not contiguous.

V13688   "CENSUS NEEDS STANDARD-1985       "

Annual Needs Standard for the 1985 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/index.html. We have used the table entitled 'Poverty thresholds
by Size of Family and Number of Children'

The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. Due to some of the limitations of our extant files, we were unable to generate the number of
months for those individuals who moved out of multiple families in the same wave. Otherwise the calculation of
needs is similar to that described in Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF.

ER30513  "COMPLETED EDUCATION          86"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1986 interview.

This variable contains values for 1986 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1986 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1986 Heads,
these were computed as follows: if V13582 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the
value for V13582. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V13568 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V13571 plus V13576. For the recency of the data, see family-level V13668.
Wives/"Wives were treated similarly: if V13512 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the
value for V13512. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V13503 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V13505 plus V13508. For the recency of the data, see family-level V13669.

All individuals who became main family nonresponse in 1986 have 1986 ID numbers equal to 0000 and zero data
values for 1986, but have nonzero data values for their 1985 records. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 1986
have nonzero data for 1986 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 1986 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are

V14732   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1987 ID number (V13702) with the lowest value from
among the 1987 ID numbers (V13702) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with other panel families were given their own values for V13702. Thus, the range of
values is 0001-7061, but the series is not contiguous.

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/index.html. We have used the table entitled 'Poverty thresholds
by Size of Family and Number of Children'

The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. Due to some of the limitations of our extant files, we were unable to generate the number of
months for those individuals who moved out of multiple families in the same wave. Otherwise the calculation of
needs is similar to that described in Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1986 Head for any individual whose 1987 sequence number (ER30536)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1986 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1987 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1987 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

ER30549  "COMPLETED EDUCATION          87"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1987 interview.

This variable contains values for 1987 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1987 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1987 Heads,
these were computed as follows: if V14629 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the
value for V14629. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V14615 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V14618 plus V14623. For the recency of the data, see family-level V14715.
Wives/"Wives were treated similarly: if V14559 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the
value for V14559. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V14550 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V14552 plus V14555. For the recency of the data, see family-level V14716.

similar variables in 1975-1984; the question regarding difficulty in reading or writing was omitted from 1985
onward. As with the component data items from which this variable is created, the values here reflect the
educational attainment level of the Head when he or she became a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained

V16207   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1988 ID number (V14802) with the lowest value from
among the 1988 ID numbers (V14802) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with other panel families were given their own values for V14802. Thus, the range of
values is 0001-7114, but the series is not contiguous.

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,

by Size of Family and Number of Children'

The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. Due to some of the limitations of our extant files, we were unable to generate the number of
months for those individuals who moved out of multiple families in the same wave. Otherwise the calculation of
needs is similar to that described in Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF.

ER30584  "COMPLETED EDUC-IND          88"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1988 interview. A code value of 17 indicates that
this individual has completed at least some postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1988 Heads and
Wives/"Wives" from family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for
them as it is for other family unit members. For 1988 Heads, these were computed as follows: if V16103 is
greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V16103. For the remaining cases, a
value of 1 at V16089 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V16092 plus V16097.
For the recency of the data, see family-level V16190. Wives/"Wives were treated similarly: if V16033 is greater
than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V16033. For the remaining cases, a value of 1

All individuals who became main family nonresponse in 1988 have 1988 ID numbers equal to 0000 and zero data
values for 1988, but have nonzero data values for their 1987 records. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 1988
have nonzero data for 1988 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 1988 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are
reserved for mover-out nonresponse.

V17584   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1989 ID number (V16302) with the lowest value from
among the 1989 ID numbers (V16302) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for V16302. The range of values is 0001-7114, but the series is not contiguous. See Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households in Section I, Part 5 in the front matter of this volume for a discussion of
ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Annual Needs Standard for the 1988 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/index.html. We have used the table entitled 'Poverty thresholds
by Size of Family and Number of Children'

The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. Due to some of the limitations of our extant files, we were unable to generate the number of
months for those individuals who moved out of multiple families in the same wave. Otherwise the calculation of
needs is similar to that described in Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF.

at the time of the 1989 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1989 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

ER30620  "COMPLETED EDUC-IND          89"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1989 interview. A code value of 17 indicates that
this individual has completed at least some postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1989 Heads and
Wives/"Wives" from 1989 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually
for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1989 Heads, these were computed as follows: if V17500 is
greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V17500. For the remaining cases, a
value of 1 at V17486 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V17489 plus V17494.
For the recency of the data, see family-level V17568. Wives/"Wives were treated similarly, using family-level
variables. For 1989, see V17421-V17430. If V17430 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus
the value for V17430. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V17421 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V17423 plus V17426. For the recency of the data, see family-level V17569.

V17710   "FAM COMP CHANGE    90        "

Family Composition Change between 1989 and 1990 Waves

Family Composition Change for the Latino sample was coded based on movers into and out of the family in which
the Temple informant was living at the time of the 1990 interview. (The Temple informant was the respondent for
the LNPS. See Section I, Parts 1 and 13 for more information) Moves from January 1, 1989 up until the time of
the 1990 interview were accounted for. This was done for comparability with the part-year income concept that
we apply to our core sample.

Codes 2 through 8 take priority over codes 0 and 1.

  Codes

           0 No change; no movers-in or movers-out of the family

           1 Change in members other than Head or Wife/"Wife" only

           2 Head is the same person as in 1989 but Wife/"Wife" left or died; Head has new
            Wife/"Wife"; used also when cohabiting, nonrelative female becomes "Wife"

           3 Wife/"Wife" from 1989 is now Head

           4 1989 female Head got married--husband (usually a nonsample member) is now Head-            Used also when cohabiting, nonrelative male becomes Head

           5 Some sample member other than 1989 Head or Wife/ "Wife" has become Head of this
            FU (Used primarily for male and unmarried female splitoffs)

           6 Some female other than 1989 Head got married and her husband (nonsample member)
            is now Head (Used primarily for married female splitoffs)

           7 Female Head in 1989 with husband in institution--husband in FU in 1990 and is now

            Head

           8 Other (used for recombined families--these are usually 1968 Heads and Wives who
            have parted for a year or more, been interviewed separately, and who have
            reconciled at some time since the 1989 interview but prior to the 1990 interview)

P-60, No. 171, Poverty in the United States: 1988 and 1989. The threshold values are based on family size, the
number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted
for changes in family composition during 1989 so that it matches part-year incomes included in the total family
money income (V18875). Please refer to Section I, Part 5 of this volume for further details about the
generation process and a reproduction of Table A-3.

similar variables in 1975-1984; the question regarding difficulty in reading or writing was omitted from 1985
onward. As with the component data items from which this variable is created, the values here reflect the
educational attainment level of the Head when he or she became a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained
the same person from the previous interview, this variable has been carried forward from the previous year's

V18936   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1990 ID number (V17702) with the lowest value from
among the 1990 ID numbers (V17702) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for V17702. The range of values is 00001-07328 for core sample FUs and 10001-12043 for Latinos,
but the series is not contiguous. No Latino sample cases were sharing with another sample family, and so their
values for this variable simply equal their values for V17702 (10001-12043). See Linking Data: Families Sharing
Households in Section 1, Part 5 in the front matter of this volume for a discussion of ways to identify shared
households in the early years of the PSID.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1989 Head for any individual whose 1990 sequence number (ER30643)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1989 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1990 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1990 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER30643=01).

ER30657  "COMPLETED EDUC-IND          90"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1990 interview. A code value of 17 indicates that
this individual has completed at least some postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1990 Heads and
Wives/"Wives" from 1990 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually
for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1990 Heads, these were computed as follows: if V18831 is
greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V18831. For the remaining cases, a
value of 1 at V18817 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V18820 plus V18825.
For the recency of the data, see family-level V18919. Wives/"Wives" were treated similarly, using family-level
variables. For 1990, see 18752-V18761. If V18761 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus
the value for V18761. For

ER30684  "TYPE OF IND RECORD 90"

Type of Individual Data Record in 1990

All core sample individuals who became main family nonresponse in 1990 have 1990 ID numbers equal to 00000 and
zero data values for 1990, but have nonzero data values for 1989 variables. Core sample mover-out nonresponse
individuals for 1990 have nonzero data for 1990 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have
1990 sequence numbers in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only;
codes 06-08 are reserved for mover-out nonresponse. Latino individuals who were in institutions in 1990 or who
had moved out or died in the year prior to the 1990 interview are included in codes 05-08.

  Codes

           1 This sample member was 18 years old or older at the time of main family
            nonresponse and had been in the FU in 1989; this 1990 elderly recontact
            individual was not successfully interviewed

           2 This sample member was less than 18 at the time of main family nonresponse and
            had been in the FU in 1989.

           3 This nonsample individual had been in the 1989 FU, and this FU became nonresponse
            in 1990.

ER30685  "WHY NONRESPONSE 90"

Reason for NonFU Membership in 1990

In general, individuals ineligible for the interview consist of those who were too young (under 18 years old) or
who are not sample members. An exception to nonsample eligibility was made for elderly nonsample individuals as
described in Section I, Part 1 of the 1990 (wave XXIII) Documentation.

  Codes

           1 Wave refusal by all eligible/available FU members.

           2 No-one at home for contact during the interviewing period.

           3 Respondent absent; some FU member contacted, but not the appropriate respondent.

           4 Lost; unable to locate any member of the FU at all.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           11 This individual was in the armed forces.

           12 This individual was in an educational institution.

           13 This individual was in a health care facility

           19 This individual was in some other type of institution, for example, a religious
            order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           21 This individual was not eligible for the interview and the Head or the Wife,
            whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
            institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

           22 This individual was not eligible for the interview and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

           23 This individual was not eligible for the interview and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized by entering a health care facility.

           24 This individual was not eligible for the interview and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized through imprisonment.

           29 This individual was not eligible for the interview and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by some means other than the above; for example, he/she may
            have entered a religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown
            are included here, also.

           31 This individual was unable to cooperate through disability.

           32 This individual was not eligible for the interview and the Head or Wife,
            whichever is sample, was unable to cooperate through disability.

           41 This individual died between the 1989 and 1990 interviews; this 1990 elderly
            recontact individual died after becoming nonresponse for some other reason but
            before the 1990 recontact attempt.

           42 This individual was not eligible for the interview and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           59 Other office error

           91 This sample individual moved out of the 1990 main family and was eligible for
            interviewing but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 1990 main family and was not eligible for
            interviewing because he/she was either nonsample or too young.

           93 The Head or Wife of this FU, whichever is sample, united with another FU; this
            individual was not eligible for the interview and therefore became nonresponse.

           97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 1990 interview
            (ER30642>0 and ER30643=0); individual from Immigrant or Latino recontact sample

V20175   "TOT FAM MONEY Y 90 "

Total 1990 Family Money Income

Negative amounts and zeroes are not allowed for this variable because it is used in the generation of the
income/needs ratio.

The values represent the summation of the following variables:

V19151 Taxable Income of Head and Wife/"Wife"
V19201 Total Transfers of Head and Wife/"Wife"

V19301 Taxable Prorated Income of Others

V19317 Total Prorated Transfers of Others

V20184   "ANNUAL NEEDS STD-CENSUS         "

Annual Needs Standards-Census

This poverty threshold was taken from Table A-2 on p. 195 of the U.S. Census' Current Population Reports, Series
P-60, No. 175, Poverty in the United States: 1990. The threshold values are based on family size, the number
of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted for
changes in family composition during 1990 so that it matches part-year incomes included in the total family
money income (V20175). Please refer to Section I, Part 5 of this volume for further details about the
generation process and a reproduction of Table A-2.

  Codes

    6,268 - 28,646 Actual poverty threshold

V20198   "COMPLETED ED-HD 91 "

1991 Head's Completed Education Level

This variable is identical to the individual-level variable V30703. Values in the range 01-16 represent the
actual grade of school completed, e.g., a value of 08 indicates that the Head completed the eighth grade. A
code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some postgraduate work. This variable contains
values from 1991 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually.
Values were computed as follows: if V20131 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the
value for V20131. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V20117 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,
completed education equals V20120 plus V20125. Education was re-asked of all Heads in 1985. See V20219 for the
recency of this information.

from 1991 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually. Values were
computed as follows: if V20061 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for

V20236   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1991 ID number (V19002) with the lowest value from
among the 1991 ID numbers (V19002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these tape locations for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for V19002. The range of values is 00001-09363, but the series is not contiguous. See Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households in Section I, Part 5 in the front matter of this volume for a discussion of
ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

ER30691  "RELATION TO HEAD 91"

1991 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1990 Head for any individual whose 1991 sequence number (ER30690)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1990 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1991 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1991 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1991 interview. A code value of 17 indicates that
this individual has completed at least some postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1991 Heads and
Wives/"Wives" from 1991 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually
for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables V20198
(Head) and V20199 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not
attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for this individual-level
variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level
V20219 (Heads) and V20220 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this information.

V20310   "FAM COMP CHANGE    92        "

Family Composition Change between 1991 and 1992 Waves

Family Composition Change for reinterview recontact and Latino recontact cases was coded based on movers into
and out of the 1992 family. Moves from January 1, 1991 up until the time of the 1992 interview were accounted
for. This was done for comparability with the part year income concept that we apply to the rest of the sample.
Sample recontacts and splitoff recontacts were coded in the same fashion as ordinary splitoffs. Codes 2 through
8 take priority over codes 0 and 1.

  Codes

           0 No change; no movers-in or movers-out of the family

           1 Change in members other than Head or Wife/"Wife" only

           2 Head is the same person as in 1991 but Wife/"Wife" left or died; Head has new
            Wife/"Wife"; used also when cohabiting, nonrelative female becomes "Wife"

           3 Wife/"Wife" from 1991 is now Head

           4 1991 female Head got married--husband (usually a nonsample member) is now Head-            Used also when cohabiting, nonrelative male becomes Head

           5 Some sample member other than 1991 Head or Wife/ "Wife" has become Head of this
            FU (Used primarily for male and unmarried female splitoffs)

           6 Some female other than 1991 Head got married and her husband (nonsample member)
            is now Head (Used primarily for married female splitoffs)

           7 Female Head in 1991 with husband in institution--husband in FU in 1992 and is now

            Head

           8 Other (used for recombined families)--these are usually 1968 Heads and Wives who
            have parted for a year or more, been interviewed separately, and who have
            reconciled at some time since the 1991 interview but prior to the 1992 interview

This poverty threshold was taken from Table A-3 on p. A-8 of the U.S. Census' Current Population Reports, Series
P-60, No. 181, Poverty in the United States: 1991. The threshold values are based on family size, the number
of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted for
changes in family composition during 1991 so that it matches part-year incomes included in the total family
money income (V21481). Please refer to Section I, Part 5 of this volume for further details about the
generation process, and the Wave XXIII (1990) documentation volume, p. 83, for a reproduction of Table A-3.

1992 Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 01-16 represent the actual grade of school completed, e.g., a value of 08 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work. This variable contains values from 1992 family-level data, although information about
completed education is not asked annually. Values were computed as follows: if V21437 is greater than zero,
then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V21437. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V21423
was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V21426 plus V21431.

V21542   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1992 ID number (V20302) with the lowest value from
among the 1992 ID numbers (V20302) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for V20302. The range of values is 00001-09829, but the series is not contiguous. See Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households in Section I, Part 5 in the front matter of this volume for a discussion of
ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

1992 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1991 Head for any individual whose 1992 sequence number (ER30734)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1991 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1992 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1992 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

ER30748  "COMPLETED EDUCATION          92"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1992 interview.

This variable contains values for 1992 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1992 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables V21504 (Head) and V21505 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and
Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level V21525 (Heads) and V21526 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this
information.

for. This was done for comparability with the part-year income concept that we apply to the rest of the sample.
Sample recontacts and splitoff recontacts were coded in the same fashion as ordinary splitoffs.

V23326   "CENSUS ANNUAL NEEDS STANDARD      "

Annual Needs Standards-CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Table A on p. vii of the U.S. Census' Current Population Reports, Series
P-60, No. 185, Poverty in the United States: 1992. The threshold values are based on family size, the number of
persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes
in family composition during 1992 so that it matches part-year incomes included in the total family money income
(V23322). Please refer to Section I, Part 5 of this volume for further details about the generation process and
a reproduction of Table A.

V23333   "COMPLETED ED-HD 1993          "

1993 Head's Completed Education Level

This variable is almost identical to the individual-level variable V30820.

Values in the range 01-16 represent the actual grade of school completed, e.g., a value of 08 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some postgraduate
work. This variable contains values from 1993 family-level data, although information about completed education
is not asked annually. Values were computed as follows:

If it is not known whether Head attended college (V23290=9) or the number of years of college is unknown
(V23293=9), then the value is 99.

If Head attended college (V23290=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (V23293).

Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (V23290=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (V23279=1), the value is 12;
(b) if Head recevied a GED (V23279=2), the value is the last grade finished (V23282);
(c) if Head neither graduated from high school, nor got a GED (V23279=3), the value is the last grade finished
(V23287);
(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (V23279=8 or 9), then the
value is 99.

This variable differs from the individual level variable V30820 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED but
did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985. See V23339 for the
recency of this information.

This variable is almost identical to the individual-level variable V30820.

Values in the range 01-16 represent the actual grade of school completed, e.g., a value of 08 indicates that the
Wife/"Wife" completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that she completed at least some
postgraduate work. This variable contains values from 1993 family-level data, although information about

If it is not known whether the Wife/"Wife" attended college (V23222=9) or the number of years of college is
unknown (V23224=9), then the value is 99.

If she attended college (V23222=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (V23224).

Otherwise, if she did not attend college, (V23222=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if she is a high school graduate (V23215=1), the value is 12;
(b) if she recevied a GED (V23215=2), the value is the last grade finished (V23217);
(c) if she neither graduated from high school, nor got a GED (V23215=3), the value is the last grade finished
(V23220);
(d) if it is not known whether she graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (V23215=8 or 9), then the
value is 99.

This variable differs from the individual level variable V30820 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received a
GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for them is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was reasked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See V23340 for

V23356   "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1993 ID number (V21602) with the lowest value from
among the 1993 ID numbers (V21602) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for V21602. The range of values is 00001-11055, but the series is not contiguous. See Linking
Data: Families Sharing Householdsin Section I, Part 5 in the front matter of this volume for a discussion of
ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

at the time of the 1993 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1993 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1993 interview.

This variable contains values for 1993 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1993 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables V23333 (Head) and V23334 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and
Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level V23339 (Heads) and V23340 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this

Total 1993 Family Money Income

Please note that this variable can contain negative values. Negative values indicate a net loss, which in waves
prior to 1994 were bottom-coded at $1, as were zero amounts. These losses occur as a result of business or farm
losses.

This variable is the sum of these five variables:

ER4146 Head and Wife/"Wife" Taxable Income-1993
ER4147 Head and Wife/"Wife" Transfer Income-1993

ER4150 Taxable Income of Other FU Members-1993

ER4155   "CENSUS NEEDS STANDARD-1993       "

Annual Needs Standard for the 1993 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,

http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html.

This table is 'Poverty Thresholds in 1993, by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years'.
The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during 1993. Please refer to
Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation

process.

ER4158   "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER3917=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with no
updating or other change. Education was asked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33115 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED.
The family-level variable value for such Heads is the highest grade completed; for the individual-level
variable, the value is 12.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33115 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received

ER4159R  "HOUSEHOLD ID# "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1994 ID number (ER2002) with the lowest value from
among the 1994 ID numbers (ER2002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER2002. The range of values is 1-16970, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1993 Head for any individual whose 1994 sequence number (ER33102)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1993 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1994 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1994 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

ER33115  "YRS COMPLETED EDUC          94"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1994 interview. A code value of 17 indicates that
this individual has completed at least some postgraduate work.

This variable contains values for 1994 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1994 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who
received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for
this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

values for 1994, but have nonzero data values for 1995 variables. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 1994
have nonzero data for 1994 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 1994 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are

ER33127  "WHY NONRESPONSE 94"

Reason for NonFU Membership in 1994

Individuals ineligible for the interview are those who are not designated as sample members. An exception was
made for nonsample individuals who are elderly, as described in Section I, Part 1, of the 1990 Documentation.

  Codes

           1 Wave refusal by all eligible/available FU members.

           2 No one at home for contact during the interviewing period.

           3 Respondent absent; some FU member contacted, but not the appropriate respondent.

           4 Lost; unable to locate any member of the FU at all.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           10 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. These individuals will
            never be asked to participate in the study again, regardless of recontact
            efforts.

           11 This individual was in the armed forces.

           12 This individual was in an educational institution.

           13 This individual was in a health care facility

           14 This individual was in jail or prison

           19 This individual was in some other type of institution, for example, a religious
            order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           21 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or the Wife,
            whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
            institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

           22 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

           23 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized by entering a health care facility.

           24 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized through imprisonment.

           29 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by some means other than the above; for example, he/she may
            have entered a religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown
            are included here, also.

           31 This individual was unable to cooperate through disability.

           32 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or Wife, whichever
            is sample, was unable to cooperate through disability.

           41 This individual died between the 1993 and 1994 interviews.

           42 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
            Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
            he/she was not followed.

           57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; paper coversheet(s)
            missing; no name or identifying information available

           58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
            the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

           59 Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous office error (does not
            include codes 1-54 above or codes 91-99 below)

           91 This individual moved out of the 1994 main family and was eligible to be
            followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 1994 main family and was not eligible to be followed

           93 All followable members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual
            was not eligible to be followed and therefore became nonresponse.

           97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 1994 interview
            (ER33101>0 and ER33102=0); individual from Immigrant sample
            (ER30001=3001-3511,4001-4462)

           98 This individual became main family or mover-out nonresponse by 1993 and was not
            selected for recontact in 1994 (ER30733=0 and ER30806=0 and ER30859=0 or
            ER30733>0 and ER30734=71-89 and ER30806=0 and ER30859=0)

           99 NA; DK

           0 Inap.: this individual was in a panel family in 1994 (ER33102=1-20)

Total 1994 Family Money Income

Please note that this variable can contain negative values. Negative values indicate a net loss, which in waves
prior to 1994 were bottom-coded at $1, as were zero amounts. These losses occur as a result of business or farm
losses.

This variable is the sum of these five variables:

ER6986 Head and Wife/"Wife" Taxable Income-1994
ER6987 Head and Wife/"Wife" Transfer Income-1994

ER6990 Taxable Income of Other FU Members-1994

Annual Needs Standard for the 1994 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,

http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html.

This table is 'Poverty Thresholds for 1994 by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years'.
The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during 1994. Please refer to
Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation

process.

NOTE: The range given is valid for this wave's calculations only.

ER6998   "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER6787=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with no
updating or other change. Education was asked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33215 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the highest grade completed; for
the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Wife/"Wife" has remained the
same person from the previous interview (ER6733=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years'
data with no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33215 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received
a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Wives/"Wives" is the highest grade
completed; for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER6999R  "HOUSEHOLD ID# "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1995 ID number (ER5002) with the lowest value from
among the 1995 ID numbers (ER5002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER5002. The range of values is 1-16970, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1994 family data, 94GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1994 Head for any individual whose 1995 sequence number (ER33202)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1994 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1995 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1995 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

  order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

21 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or the Wife,
  whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
  institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

22 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
  institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

23 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
  institutionalized by entering a health care facility.

24 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
  institutionalized through imprisonment.

29 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became

  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
  office error.

52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
  this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
  Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
  he/she was not followed.

57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; paper coversheet(s)
  missing; no name or identifying information available

58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
  the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

59 Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous office error (does not
  include codes 1-54 above or codes 91-99 below)

91 This individual moved out of the 1995 main family and was eligible to be
  followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

92 Individual moved out of the 1995 main family and was not eligible to be followed

93 All followable members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual
  was not eligible to be followed and therefore became nonresponse.

97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 1995 interview
  (ER33201>0 and ER33202=0); individual from Immigrant sample
  (ER30001=3001-3511,4001-4462)

ER9244   "TOTAL FAMILY INCOME-1995 "

Total 1995 Family Money Income

Please note that this variable can contain negative values. Negative values indicate a net loss, which in waves
prior to 1994 were bottom-coded at $1, as were zero amounts. These losses occur as a result of business or farm
losses.

This variable is the sum of these five variables:

ER9237 Head and Wife/"Wife" Taxable Income-1995
ER9238 Head and Wife/"Wife" Transfer Income-1995

ER9241 Taxable Income of Other FU Members-1995

ER9246   "CENSUS NEEDS STANDARD-1995       "

Annual Needs Standard for the 1995 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,

http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html.

This table is 'Poverty Thresholds for 1995 by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years.'
The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during 1995. Please refer to
Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation

process.

ER9249   "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER9033=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with no
updating or other change. Education was asked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33315 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the highest grade completed; for
the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

Wife's/"Wife's" Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Wife/"Wife" completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Wife/"Wife" completed at least
some postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Wife/"Wife" has remained the
same person from the previous interview (ER8979=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years'
data with no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33315 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received
a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed;
for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER9250R  "HOUSEHOLD ID# "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1996 ID number (ER7002) with the lowest value from
among the 1996 ID numbers (ER7002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER7002. The range of values is 1-16970, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1995 family data, 95GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

1996 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1995 Head for any individual whose 1996 sequence number (ER33302)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1995 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1996 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1996 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1996 interview.

This variable contains values for 1996 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1996 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who
received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for
this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

            is sample, was unable to cooperate through disability.

           41 This individual died between the 1995 and 1996 interviews.

           42 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
            Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
            he/she was not followed.

           57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; paper coversheet(s)
            missing; no name or identifying information available

           58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
            the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

            dropped beginning in 1996.Individual connected with the Immigrant 17 sample
            (ER30001=4001-4462).

           81 This non-sample elderly individual was followed during the period 1990 through
            1995. If he or she was not living with a followable individual in 1996, then he
            or she was dropped from the study in 1996. Other non-followable individuals
            connected with dropped non-sample elderly families are also included here.

           91 This individual moved out of the 1996 main family and was eligible to be
            followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 1996 main family and was not eligible to be followed,

           93 All followable members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual
            was not eligible to be followed and therefore became nonresponse.

ER12079  "TOTAL FAMILY INCOME "

Total Family Money Income in 1996

The income reported here was collected in 1997 about tax year 1996. Please note that this variable can contain
negative values. The negative values indicate a net loss, which in waves prior to 1994 were bottom-coded at $1.
These losses occur as a result of business or farm losses.

Dollar amounts are based on values for the year in which they are reported. Thus, dollar amounts reported in
1997 for the prior year are in 1996 dollars.

This variable is the sum of the 1996 variables below:

taxable income of head and wife (ER12069),
transfer income of head and wife (ER12071),
taxable income of other family unit members (OFUMs) (ER12073),
transfer income of OFUMs (ER12075), and
Social Security income (ER12077).

New Immigrant Sample families (ER10002=10001-10444) have values for this variable.

ER12220  "CENSUS NEEDS STANDARD-1996       "

Annual Needs Standard for the 1996 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html. This is Table, 'Poverty Thresholds for 1996 by Size of
Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years: 1996.' The threshold values are based on family size, the
number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted
for changes in family composition during 1996. Please refer to Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID
data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation process.

Values were not calculated for the Immigrant sample; see the codeframe below.

ER12222  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER11712=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33415 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the highest grade completed; for
the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER12223  "COMPLETED ED-WF "

Wife's/"Wife's" Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Wife/"Wife" completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Wife/"Wife" completed at least
some postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Wife/"Wife" has remained the
same person from the previous interview (ER11731=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years'
data with no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33415 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received
a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed;
for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER12223R  "HOUSEHOLD ID# "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1997 ID number (ER10002) with the lowest value from
among the 1997 ID numbers (ER10002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER7002. The range of values is 1-16970, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1997 family data, 97GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

ER33403  "RELATION TO HEAD 97"

1997 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1996 Head for any individual whose 1997 sequence number (ER33402)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1996 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1997 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1997 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER33402=01).

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1997 interview.

This variable contains values for 1997 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1997 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who
received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for
this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

19 This individual was in some other type of institution, for example, a religious
  order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

21 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or the Wife,
  whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
  institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

22 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
  institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

23 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
  institutionalized by entering a health care facility.

24 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
  institutionalized through imprisonment.

29 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
  institutionalized by some means other than the above; for example, he/she may

41 This individual died between the 1996 and 1997 interviews.

42 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
  nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
  persons and therefore has become nonsample.

51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
  office error.

52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
  this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
  Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
  he/she was not followed.

57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; paper coversheet(s)
  missing; no name or identifying information available

58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
  the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

59 Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous office error (does not
  include codes 1-54 above or codes 91-99 below)

May 2008: Variables ER16467 to ER16517, formerly available separately, have now been incorportated into this
file, with new variable names. Variable ER16518 has been recalculated. Variable ER16519, a family
cross-sectional weight, has been added.

November 2013: Added generated variables such as Family Composition Change (ER13008A), Births to HD/WF/OFUM
(ER16517A-ER16517H), Region where HD grew up (ER16431A), HD Geographic Mobility (ER16431B), Interview length
(ER13005B), mode of interview (ER13005C), and calls for interview (ER13005D). Also we have brought forward the
background section for old Heads and Wives in section KL. Corrected data for Beale Rural-Urban Code (ER16431)
although this variable will now be suppressed on the public release file.

February 2014: For Release 6 we have added one new variable Collapsed Beale (ER16431C). Additionally we have
completed contingency corrections for a handful of cases for the family level T-2 variables ER16221-ER16223
ER16230-ER16245 after further cleaning of corresponding individual level T-2 variables.

January 2016: For Release 7 we have added one new variable Splitoff Indicator (ER13005E). Additionally we have
corrected the top code values for A20 and A21 (ER13041 and ER13042) to match the codebook description. We have
corrected the bottom code for H14/H38 (ER15544/ER15652) and H17/H41 (ER15547/ER15655) for both Head and
Wife/"Wife" where 1 means one cigarette or fewer per day.

November 2017: For Release 8, we have added 25 generated food security variables (ER14331A-ER14331Y). The food
security variables were put through the same imputation and calculation process as was completed on the 2015
data to produce food security scale score and category. We have also added the aggregated consumption variables
(ER16515A1-ER16515D6). These variables were previously released on a supplemental file.

Annual Needs Standard for the 1998 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website, from a main-page search for
People/Poverty/Detailed Poverty Tables. This is Table 21. Poverty Thresholds by Size of Family and Number of
Related Children: 1998. The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under
age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during
1998. Please refer to Section I, Part 5 of 1993, Wave XXVI documentation for further details about the
generation process.

NOTE: the range given is valid for this wave's calculations only.

ER16454 Transfer Income of Head and Wife/"Wife",
ER16456 Taxable Income of Other Family Unit Members (OFUMs),

ER16516  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER15890=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33516 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the highest grade completed; for
the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33516 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received
a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed;
for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER33501  "1999 INTERVIEW NUMBER "

1999 Interview Number (1999 ID Number)

The values for this variable represent the 1999 interview number of the family in which this individual was
included in 1999. We interviewed a total of 6,997 families in 1999, 70 of whom were Immigrant "recontacts"--that
is, who were eligible but nonresponse for the 1997 Immigrant sample or who were ineligible in 1997 but became
eligible by 1999. This group of 70 families is referred to as the Immigrant recontact sample.

  Codes

       1 - 6,985 1999 family interview number for core and 1997 Immigrant sample families

   10,001 - 10,071 1999 family interview number for 1999 Immigrant recontact sample families

           0 This individual was main family nonresponse by 1999 or mover-out nonresponse by
            1997; from Latino sample (ER30001=7001-9308); from Immigrant 2017 sample
            (ER30001=4001-4462)

ER33502  "SEQUENCE NUMBER 99"

1999 Sequence Number

This variable provides a means of identifying an individual's status with regard to the FU at the time of the
1999 interview.

  Codes

        1 - 20 Individuals in the family at the time of the 1999 interview

        51 - 59 Individuals in institutions at the time of the 1999 interview

ER33503  "RELATION TO HEAD 99"

1999 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1997 Head for any individual whose 1999 sequence number (ER33502)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1997 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 1999 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1999 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER33502=01).

ER33516  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       99"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1999 interview.

This variable contains values for 1999 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1999 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who
received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for
this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

values for 1999, but have nonzero data values for 1997 variables. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 1999
have nonzero data for 1999 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 1999 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are
reserved for mover-out nonresponse. Codes 21 and 26 indicate individuals who were selected for recontact in 1999
who were not successfully interviewed.

ER33545  "WHY NONRESPONSE 99"

Reason for NonFU Membership in 1999

Individuals ineligible for the interview are those who are not designated as sample members. An exception was
made for nonsample individuals who are elderly, as described in Section I, Part 1, of the 1990 Documentation.

  Codes

           1 Wave refusal by all eligible/available FU members.

           2 No one at home for contact during the interviewing period.

           3 Respondent absent; some FU member contacted, but not the appropriate respondent.

           4 Lost; unable to locate any member of the FU at all.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           10 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. These individuals will
            never be asked to participate in the study again, regardless of recontact
            efforts.

           11 This individual was in the armed forces.

           12 This individual was in an educational institution.

           13 This individual was in a health care facility

           14 This individual was in jail or prison

           19 This individual was in some other type of institution, for example, a religious
            order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           21 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or the Wife,
            whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
            institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

           22 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

           23 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized by entering a health care facility.

           24 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized through imprisonment.

           29 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by some means other than the above; for example, he/she may
            have entered a religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown
            are included here, also.

           31 This individual was unable to cooperate through disability.

           32 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or Wife, whichever
            is sample, was unable to cooperate through disability.

           41 This individual died between the 1997 and 1999 interviews; this individual died
            after becoming nonresponse for some other reason before the 1997 interview.

           42 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
            persons and therefore has become nonsample.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
            Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
            he/she was not followed. However, beginning in the 1999 wave, he/she is eligible
            for recontact efforts in the next wave.

           57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; paper coversheet(s)
            missing; no name or identifying information available

           58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
            the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

           59 Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous office error (does not
            include codes 1-54 above or codes 91-99 below)

           60 This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer followable and became
            nonresponse because either the child is now aged 25 or is nonresponse and was not
            selected for recontact in the next wave.

           61 This individual was not eligible to be followed and was associated with a family
            containing a person erroneously designated as followable; the erroneous person's
            code is 51, 53, 54, or 60.

            dropped beginning in 1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample due
            to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped beginning in 1997.

           91 This individual moved out of the 1994 main family and was eligible to be
            followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 1994 main family and was not eligible to be followed,
            including the nonsample elderly

           93 All followable members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual
            was not eligible to be followed and therefore became nonresponse.

ER17001  "RELEASE NUMBER "

Release Number

May 2008: Variables ER20395-ER20458, formerly available separately, have now been incorporated into this file
with those variable names. Variable ER20394 has been recalculated. Variable ER20459, a family cross-sectional
weight, has been added.

November 2013: Added generated variables Births to HD/WF/OFUM (ER20458A-ER20458H), Region HD Grew Up (ER20377A),
Head Geographic Mobility (ER20377B), K-6 Distress Scale (ER19833A). Also added Calls for Iw (ER17005B), and Iw
Length (ER17005C). For this release we have also updated some of the KL background variables that were not ready
at the time of the original 2001 release. On release 3, we are suppressing some additional variables to protect
the anonymity of our respondents.

February 2014: For Release 4 we have added one new coded variable in the philanthropy section (ER20081A) and
Collapsed Beale (ER20377C). Additionally, we have corrected extant T-2 variables for a handful of cases.

January 2016: For Release 5 we have corrected the bottom code for H14/H38 (ER19709/ER19817) and H17/H41
(ER19712/ER19820) for both Head and Wife/"Wife" where 1 means one cigarette or fewer per day.

November 2017: For Release 6 we have added 25 generated food security variables (ER18470A-ER18470Y). The food
security variables were put through the same imputation and calculation process as was completed on the 2015
data to produce food security scale score and category. We have also added the aggregated consumption variables
(ER20456A1-ER20456D6) to the family release file. These variables were previously released on a supplemental
file.

Related Children: 2000. The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under
age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during
2000. Please refer to Section I, Part 5 of 1993, Wave XXVI documentation for further details about the

ER20457  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER19951=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33616 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the highest grade completed; for
the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1999 Head for any individual whose 2001 sequence number (ER33602)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 1999 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 2001 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2001 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER33602=01).

ER33616  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       01"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2001 interview.

This variable contains values for 2001 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2001 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who
received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for
this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

ER33636  "WHY NONRESPONSE 01"

Reason for NonFU Membership in 2001

Individuals ineligible for the interview are those who are not designated as sample members. An exception was
made for nonsample individuals who are elderly, as described in Section I, Part 1, of the 1990 Documentation.

  Codes

           1 Wave refusal by all eligible/available FU members.

           2 No one at home for contact during the interviewing period.

           3 Respondent absent; some FU member contacted, but not the appropriate respondent.

           4 Lost; unable to locate any member of the FU at all.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           10 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. These individuals will
            never be asked to participate in the study again, regardless of recontact
            efforts.

           11 This individual was in the armed forces.

           12 This individual was in an educational institution.

           13 This individual was in a health care facility

           14 This individual was in jail or prison

           19 This individual was in some other type of institution, for example, a religious
            order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           21 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or the Wife,
            whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
            institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

           22 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

           23 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized by entering a health care facility.

           24 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became
            institutionalized through imprisonment.

           29 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by some means other than the above; for example, he/she may
            have entered a religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown
            are included here, also.

           31 This individual was unable to cooperate through disability.

           32 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or Wife, whichever
            is sample, was unable to cooperate through disability.

           41 This individual died between the 1999 and 2001 interviews; this individual died
            after becoming nonresponse for some other reason before the 1999 interview.

```

```
           42 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
            persons and therefore has become nonsample.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
            Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
            he/she was not followed. However, beginning in the 1999 wave, he/she is eligible
            for recontact efforts in the next wave.

           57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no name or identifying
            information available

           58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
            the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

           59 Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous office error (does not
            include codes 1-54 above or codes 91-99 below)

           60 This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer followable and became
            nonresponse because either the child is now aged 25 or is nonresponse and was not
            selected for recontact in the next wave.

           61 This individual was not eligible to be followed and was associated with a family
            containing a person erroneously designated as followable; the erroneous person's
            code is 51, 53, 54, or 60.

           80 Individual connected with the Latino sample (ER30001=7001-9308); this sample was
            dropped beginning in 1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample due
            to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped beginning in 1997.

           91 This individual moved out of the 2001 main family and was eligible to be
            followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 2001 main family and was not eligible to be followed,
            including the nonsample elderly

           93 All followable members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual
            was not eligible to be followed and therefore became nonresponse.

           97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 2001 interview
            (ER33601>0 and ER33602=0); individual from Immigrant 17 sample

ER21001  "RELEASE NUMBER "

Release Number

May 2008: Variable ER23268 has been reconstructed; variable ER24179 has been recalculated. Variable ER24180, a
family cross-sectional weight, has been added.

November 2013: Correcting Births to OFUMS in 2001 (ER24178) and suppressing previously released variables Beale
Rural-Urban Code (ER24144), and Size of Largest City the county (ER24145).

February 2014: For Release 6 we have added four new coded variables in the philanthropy section M12code,
M41code, M43code and M52code (ER23542A, ER23664A, ER23674A, ER23697A). Additionally we have added fourteen new
T-2 (Section R) variables (ER23718A-ER23718N) and Collapsed Beale (ER24144A).

January 2016: For Release 7 we have added 96 new variables in the T-2 (2001) Income section, 86 of which are
about time unemployed for Head (ER23702A1-ER23702B5) and Wife/"Wife" (ER23702F4-ER23702G8), time out of the
labor force for Head (ER23702B6-ER23702D1) and Wife/"Wife" (ER23702G9-ER23702J4), and time employed for Head
(ER23702D2-ER23702E7) and Wife/"Wife" (ER23702J5-ER23702L1). The other 10 new variables are T-2 hours worked,
labor income, and accuracy checks for Head (ER23702E8-ER23702F3) and for Wife/"Wife" (ER23702L2-ER23702L6).

November 2017: For release 8, we have added 25 generated food security variables (ER21735A-ER23735Y). The food
security variables were put through the same imputation and calculation process as was completed on the 2015
data to produce food security scale score and category. We also added the aggregated consumption variables
(ER24138A1-ER24138D6) to the family release file. These variables were previously released on a supplemental
file.

           3 Wife/"wife" from 2001 is now head

           4 2001 female head got married--husband (usually a nonsample member) is now head.
            Used also when cohabiting nonrelative male becomes head

           5 Some followable individual other than 2001 head or wife/"wife" has become head of
            this FU. (Used primarily for male and unmarried female splitoffs.)

           6 Some followable female other than 2001 head got married and her husband is now

The income reported here was collected in 2003 about tax year 2002. Please note that this variable can contain
negative values. Negative values indicate a net loss, which in waves prior to 1994 were bottom-coded at $1, as
were zero amounts. These losses occur as a result of business or farm losses.

This variable is the sum of these five 2002 variables:

ER24100 Head and Wife/"Wife" Taxable Income

Annual Needs Standard for the 2002 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website, www.census.gov:80/hhes/poverty/threshld.html.
This is Table A, 'Poverty Thresholds by Size of Family and Number of Related Children: 2002.' The threshold
values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the
householder. This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during 2002. Please refer to
Section I, Part 5 of 1993 (Wave XXVI) documentation for further details about the generation process.

ER24148  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

2003 Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college
(ER23446=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER23449=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Head attended college (ER23446=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER23449). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER23446=5), the values are as follows:
(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER23435=1), the value is 12;
(b) if Head received a GED (ER23435=2), the value is the last grade finished
(ER23438);
(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER23435=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER23443);
(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or
neither (ER23435=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER23388=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985. See ER24153 for the recency of this
information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33716 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

Wife/"Wife" completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Wife/"Wife" completed at least
some postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" attended
college (ER23354=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER23357=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" attended college (ER23354=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER23357). Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" did not attend college, (ER23354=5), the values are as follows:
(a) if Wife/"Wife" is a high school graduate (ER23343=1), the value is 12;
(b) if Wife/"Wife" received a GED (ER23343=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER23346);
(c) if Wife/"Wife" neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER23343=3), the value is the last grade
finished (ER23351);
(d) if it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER23343=8 or 9),
then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Wife/"Wife" has remained the
same person from the previous interview (ER23303=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years'
data with no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See ER24154 for the
recency of this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33716 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received
a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed;
for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER24170  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2003 ID number (ER21002) with the lowest value from
among the 2003 ID numbers (ER21002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER21002. The range of values is 1-7870, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5 of the 1993 (Wave XXVI) documentation for a discussion
of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

           0 Inap.: born or moved in after the 2003 interview; from Latino sample
            (ER30001=7001-9308); from Immigrant 2017 sample (ER30001=4001-4462); main family
            nonresponse by 2003 or mover-out nonresponse by 2001 (ER33701=0)

ER33703  "RELATION TO HEAD 03"

2003 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 2001 Head for any individual whose 2003 sequence number (ER33702)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 2001 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 2003 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2003 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 for Relationship to Head (this
variable) AND coded 01 for sequence number (ER33702).

ER33716  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       03"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2003 interview.

This variable contains values for 2003 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2003 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables ER24148 (Head) and ER24149 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and
Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level ER24153 (Heads) and ER24154 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this
information.

Type of Individual Data Record in 2003

All individuals who became main family nonresponse in 2003 have 2003 ID numbers equal to 00000 and zero data
values for 2003, but have nonzero data values for 2001 variables. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 2003
have nonzero data for 2003 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 2003 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are
reserved for mover-out nonresponse. Codes 21 and 26 indicate individuals who were selected for recontact in 2003
who were not successfully interviewed.

            order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           21 This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the Head or the Wife,
            whichever is the sample member, became main family nonresponse because he/she was
            institutionalized by joining the armed forces.

           22 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, became
            institutionalized by entering an educational institution.

           23 This individual was not eligible to be followed and became main family
            nonresponse because the Head or Wife, whichever is the sample member, became

51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
  office error.

52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
  this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

56 This individual became a followable non-sample parent (had baby) in this wave.
  Because the PSID predetermines followability before entering the field each wave,
  he/she was not followed. However, beginning in the 2001 wave, he/she is eligible
  for recontact efforts in the next wave.

57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no name or identifying
  information available

58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
  the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

59 Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous office error (does not
  include codes 1-54 above or codes 91-99 below)

60 This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer followable and became
  nonresponse because either the child is now aged 25 or is nonresponse and was not
  selected for recontact in the next wave.

61 This individual was not eligible to be followed and was associated with a family
  containing a person erroneously designated as followable; the erroneous person's
  code is 45, 51, 53, 54, or 60.

80 Individual connected with the Latino sample (ER30001=7001-9308); this sample was
  dropped beginning in 1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample due
  to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped beginning in 1997.

91 This individual moved out of the 2003 main family and was eligible to be
  followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

92 Individual moved out of the 2003 main family and was not eligible to be followed,
  including the nonsample elderly

93 All followable members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual
  was not eligible to be followed and therefore became nonresponse.

97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 2003 interview
  (ER33701>0 and ER33702=0); individual from Immigrant 17 sample
  (ER30001=4001-4462)

ER25001  "RELEASE NUMBER "

Release Number

November 2013: Correcting the following four variables: Births to OFUMS in 2003 (ER28077), Number of businesses
owned by FU in 2004 (ER27907), Number of businesses owned by Head (ER27912), and Number of businesses owned by
Wife (ER27942). Due to further hand look-ups after Release 2 was made, there are 198 cases that have different
values for Head and Wife Taxable Income - 2004 (ER27953) and Total Family Money Income - 2004 (ER28037). In
addition, we are suppressing previously released variables Beale Rural-Urban Code (ER28043), and Size of Largest
City the county (ER28044).

February 2014: For Release 4 we have added four new coded variables in the philanthropy section M12code,
M41code, M43code and M52code (ER27510A, ER27634A, ER27644A, ER27667A) and Collapsed Beale (ER28043A). In
addition we have dropped fifteen previously released variables from the T-2 (Section R) range (ER27712-ER27726).
These were originally released as family level variables for Head and Wife/"Wife" but since they also contain
data for OFUMs, we have moved them to the Cross Year Individual File instead.

January 2016: For Release 5 we have added 96 new variables in the T-2 (2003) Income section, 86 of which are
about time unemployed for Head (ER27711A1-ER27711B5) and Wife/"Wife" (ER27711F4-ER27711G8), time out of the
labor force for Head (ER27711B6-ER27711D1) and Wife/"Wife" (ER27711G9-ER27711J4), and time employed for Head
(ER27711D2-ER27711E7) and Wife/"Wife" (ER27711J5-ER27711L1). The other 10 new variables are T-2 hours worked,
labor income, and accuracy checks for Head (ER27711E8-ER27711F3) and for Wife/"Wife" (ER27711L2- ER27711L6).

November 2017: For Release 6 we have added the aggregated consumption variables (ER28037A1-ER28037E3). These
variables were previously released on a supplemental file. A correction was made to the imputation of missing
data for vehicle gasoline costs, additional vehicle costs, and vehicle repair costs.

           3 Wife/"wife" from 2003 is now head

           4 2003 female head got married--husband (usually a nonsample member) is now head.
            Used also when cohabiting nonrelative male becomes head

           5 Some followable individual other than 2003 head or wife/"wife" has become head of

Annual Needs Standard for the 2004 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html. This is Table, 'Poverty Thresholds for 2004 by Size of
Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years: 2004.' The threshold values are based on family size, the
number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted
for changes in family composition during 2004. Please refer to Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID
data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation process.

ER28047  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college
(ER27413=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER27416=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Head attended college (ER27413=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER27416). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER27413=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER27402=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER27402=2), the value is the last grade finished
(ER27405);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER27402=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER27410);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or
neither (ER27402=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER27352=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985. See ER28052 for the recency of this
information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33817 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER28069  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2005 ID number (ER25002) with the lowest value from
among the 2005 ID numbers (ER25002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER25002. The range of values is 1-8041, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

ER33803  "RELATION TO HEAD 05"

2005 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 2003 Head for any individual whose 2005 sequence number (ER33802)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 2003 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 2005 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2005 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER33802) are coded 01.

ER33817  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       05"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2005 interview.

This variable contains values for 2005 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2005 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables ER28047 (Head) and ER28048 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and
Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level ER28052 (Heads) and ER28053 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this
information.

values for 2005, but have nonzero data values for 2003 variables. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 2005
have nonzero data for 2005 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 2005 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are
reserved for mover-out nonresponse. Codes 21 and 26 indicate individuals who were selected for recontact in 2005
who were not successfully interviewed.

January 2012: For Release 3, we have reconfigured variable ER36106 A50 Why did you move? We have recoded cases originally coded as 'Other/ambiguous' into existing categories where
possible.

December 2013: Correcting the following variable; Births to OFUMS only - 2005 (ER41067) and P20b Whether amount
10,000 (ER37762) In addition, we are suppressing two previously publicly released variables Beale Rural-Urban
Code (ER41033) and Size of Largest City in County (ER41034).

February 2014: In Release 5, we have added one new coded variable in the philanthropy section M12code (ER40681A)
and Collapsed Beale (ER41033A). Additionally, we have corrected extant T-2 variables for a handful of cases.

January 2016: For Release 6 we have added 96 new variables in the T-2 (2005) Income section, 86 of which are
about time unemployed for Head (ER40686A1-ER40686B5) and Wife/"Wife" (ER40686F4-ER40686G8), time out of the
labor force for Head (ER40686B6-ER40686D1) and Wife/"Wife" (ER40686G9-ER40686J4), and time employed for Head
(ER40686D2-ER40686E7) and Wife/"Wife" (ER40686J5-ER40686L1). The other 10 new variables are T-2 hours worked,
labor income, and accuracy checks for Head (ER40686E8-ER40686F3) and for Wife/"Wife" (ER40686L2- ER40686L6).

November 2017: For Release 7 we have added the aggregated consumption variables (ER41027A1-ER41027E3). These
variables were previously released on a supplemental file. A correction was made to the imputation of missing
data for vehicle gasoline costs, additional vehicle costs, and vehicle repair costs.

Annual Needs Standard for the 2006 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld.html. This is Table, 'Poverty Thresholds for 2006 by Size of
Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years: 2006.' The threshold values are based on family size, the
number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been adjusted
for changes in family composition during 2006. Please refer to Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993 PSID

ER41037  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college
(ER40585=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER40588=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Head attended college (ER40585=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER40588). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER40585=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER40574=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER40574=2), the value is the last grade finished
(ER40577);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER40574=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER40582);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or
neither (ER40574=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER40527=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985. See ER41042 for the recency of this
information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33917 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

some postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" attended
college (ER40492=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER40495=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" attended college (ER40492=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER40495). Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" did not attend college, (ER40492=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Wife/"Wife" is a high school graduate (ER40481=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Wife/"Wife" received a GED (ER40481=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER40484);

(c) if Wife/"Wife" neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER40481=3), the value is the last grade
finished (ER40489);

(d) if it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER40481=8 or 9),
then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Wife/"Wife" has remained the
same person from the previous interview (ER40438=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years'
data with no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See ER41043 for the
recency of this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33917 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received

ER41059  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2007 ID number (ER36002) with the lowest value from
among the 2007 ID numbers (ER36002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER36002. The range of values is 1-8041, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

ER33903  "RELATION TO HEAD 07"

2007 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 2005 Head for any individual whose 2007 sequence number (ER33902)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 2005 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 2007 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2007 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER33902) are coded 01.

ER33917  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       07"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2007 interview.

This variable contains values for 2007 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2007 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables ER41037 (Head) and ER41038 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and
Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level ER41042 (Heads) and ER41043 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this
information.

ER42001  "RELEASE NUMBER "

Release Number

November 2013: An error was corrected for how Completed Education for Head (ER46981) and for Wife/"Wife"
(ER46982) were calculated for old Heads and Wives/"Wive's". Since all education questions were re-asked in 2009,
completed education summary variables should have been re-calculated based on this new information for old Heads
and Wives/"Wives" collected in 2009. The correction included bringing the corrected 2009 data forward to 2011.

We are also correcting the summary variable Births to OFUMS only - 2007 (ER47011).

In addition, in Release 2 we are suppressing two previously publicly released variables Beale Rural-Urban Code
(ER46975) and Size of Largest City in County (ER46976).

February 2014: In Release 3 we have added one new coded variable in the philanthropy section M12code (ER46659A)
and Collapsed Beale (ER46975A).

ER46981  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Release 2 Note: An error was corrected for how Completed Education for Head (ER46981) and for Wife/"Wife"
(ER46982) were calculated for old Heads and Wives/"Wive's". Since all education questions were re-asked in 2009,
completed education summary variables should have been re-calculated based on this new information for old Heads
and Wives/"Wives" collected in 2009. The correction included bringing the corrected 2009 data forward to 2011.

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college
(ER46563=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER46566=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Head attended college (ER46563=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER46566). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER46563=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER46552=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER46552=2), the value is the last grade finished
(ER46555);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER46552=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER46560);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or
neither (ER46552=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER46504=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985 and 2009. See ER46950 for the recency of
this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER34020 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER46982  "COMPLETED ED-WF "

Wife's/"Wife's" Completed Education Level

Release 2 Note: An error was corrected for how Completed Education for Head (ER46981) and for Wife/"Wife"
(ER46982) were calculated for old Heads and Wives/"Wive's". Since all education questions were re-asked in 2009,
completed education summary variables should have been re-calculated based on this new information for old Heads
and Wives/"Wives" collected in 2009. The correction included bringing the corrected 2009 data forward to 2011.

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Wife/"Wife" completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Wife/"Wife" completed at least
some postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" attended
college (ER46469=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER46472=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" attended college (ER46469=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER46472). Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" did not attend college, (ER46469=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Wife/"Wife" is a high school graduate (ER46458=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Wife/"Wife" received a GED (ER46458=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER46461);

(c) if Wife/"Wife" neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER46458=3), the value is the last grade
finished (ER46466);

(d) if it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER46458=8 or 9),
then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Wife/"Wife" has remained the
same person from the previous interview (ER46410=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years'
data with no updating or other change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985 and 2009. See ER46951
for the recency of this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER34020 in the treatment of Wives/"Wives" who received
a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed;
for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER47003  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2009 ID number (ER42002) with the lowest value from
among the 2009 ID numbers (ER42002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER42002. The range of values is 1-8738, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

ER34003  "RELATION TO HEAD 09"

2009 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 2007 Head for any individual whose 2009 sequence number (ER34002)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 2007 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 2009 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2009 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER34002) are coded 01.

ER34020  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       09"

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2009 interview.

This variable contains values for 2009 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2009 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables ER46981 (Head) and ER46982 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and
Wives/"Wives" in 2009.

All individuals who became main family nonresponse in 2009 have 2009 ID numbers equal to 00000 and zero data
values for 2009, but have nonzero data values for 2007 variables. Mover-out nonresponse individuals for 2009
have nonzero data for 2009 just as response individuals do; however, the movers-out have 2009 sequence numbers
in the range 51-89. Codes 01-04 below apply to main family nonresponse individuals only; codes 06-08 are
reserved for mover-out nonresponse. Codes 21 and 26 indicate individuals who were selected for recontact in 2009
who were not successfully interviewed.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           10 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. These individuals will
            never be asked to participate in the study again, regardless of recontact

            religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included
            here, also.

           21 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or the
            Wife, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized by joining the
            armed forces.

           22 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, became institutionalized by entering an educational
            institution.

           23 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or

            Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
            persons and therefore has become nonsample.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

ER47301  "RELEASE NUMBER "

Release Number

November 2013: An error was corrected for how Completed Education for Head (ER52405) and for
Wive/"Wife"(ER52406) were calculated for old Heads and Wives/"Wive's". Since all education questions were
re-asked in 2009, completed education summary variables should have been re-calculated in 2009 based on this new
information for old Heads and Wives/"Wives". The correction included bringing the corrected 2009 data forward to
2011.

We are also correcting the summary variable Births to OFUMS only - 2009 (ER52435).

November 2013: In Release 2 we are suppressing two previously publicly released variables Beale Rural-Urban Code
(ER52399) and Size of Largest City in County (ER52400).

February 2014: For Release 3 we have added five new coded variables in the philanthropy section M12 code,
M41code, M43code, M52HDcode, M52WFcode (ER52020A, ER52037A, ER52055A, ER52045A, ER52063A) and Collapsed Beale
(ER52399A).

January 2016: For Release 4 we have added 74 new variables in the T-2 (2009) Income section: Number of Jobs for
Head (ER52071A) and Wife/"Wife" (ER52082A), months employed for Head (ER52071B-ER52071M) and Wife/"Wife"
(ER52082B-ER52082M), months unemployed for Head (ER52067A-ER52067L) and Wife/"Wife" (ER52078A-ER52078L), and
months out of the labor force for Head (ER52069A-ER52069L) and Wife/"Wife" (ER52080A-ER52080L).

November 2017: For Release 5 we have added the aggregated consumption variables (ER52395A1-ER52395E3). These
variables were previously released on a supplemental file. Corrections were made to the imputation of missing
data for vehicle gasoline costs, additional vehicle costs, and vehicle repair costs, and to the calculation on
total mortgage payment.

ER52405  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Release 2 Note: An error was corrected for how Completed Education for Head (ER52405) and for
Wive/"Wife"(ER52406) were calculated for old Heads and Wives/"Wive's". Since all education questions were
re-asked in 2009, completed education summary variables should have been re-calculated in 2009 based on this new
information for old Heads and Wives/"Wives". The correction included bringing the corrected 2009 data forward to
2011.

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that the Head completed at least some
postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college
(ER51924=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER51927=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Head attended college (ER51924=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER51927). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER51924=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER51913=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER51913=2), the value is the last grade finished
(ER51916);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER51913=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER51921);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or
neither (ER51913=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has remained the same person
from the previous interview (ER51865=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with
no updating or other change. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985 and 2009. See ER52354 for the recency
of this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER34119 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

Release 2 Note: An error was corrected for how Completed Education for Head (ER52405) and for

college (ER51830=8 or 9) or the number of years of college is unknown (ER51833=8 or 9), then the value is 99.
Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" attended college (ER51830=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college
attended (ER51833). Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" did not attend college, (ER51830=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Wife/"Wife" is a high school graduate (ER51819=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Wife/"Wife" received a GED (ER51819=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER51822);

finished (ER51827);

(d) if it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER51819=8 or 9),

ER52427  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2011 ID number (ER47302) with the lowest value from
among the 2011 ID numbers (ER47302) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER47302. The range of values is 1-8738, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Note that these relationships are those to the 2009 Head for any individual whose 2011 sequence number (ER34102)
is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the 2009 Head is no longer present
at the time of the 2011 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2011 Head also is coded
10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence
numbers (ER34102) are coded 01.

this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2011 interview.

This variable contains values for 2011 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2011 family-level data, although information
about completed education is not asked annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable
differs from the family-level variables ER52405 (Head) and ER52406 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and
Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the
grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER34153  "WHY NONRESPONSE 11"

Reason for NonFU Membership in 2011

  Codes

           1 Wave refusal by all eligible/available FU members.

           2 No one at home for contact during the interviewing period.

           3 Respondent absent; some FU member contacted, but not the appropriate respondent.

           4 Lost; unable to locate any member of the FU at all.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           10 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. These individuals will
            never be asked to participate in the study again, regardless of recontact
            efforts.

           11 This sample member was in the armed forces.

           12 This sample member was in an educational institution.

           13 This sample member was in a health care facility.

           14 This sample member was in jail or prison.

           15 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. Sample individual (or
            other FU member on their behalf) contacted the study or IRB (by letter, email,
            phone call to the 800#, or respondent-initiated phone call to the interviewer)
            with a strong request to be removed from the study.

           19 This sample member was in some other type of institution; for example, a
            religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included
            here, also.

           21 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or the
            Wife, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized by joining the
            armed forces.

           22 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, became institutionalized by entering an educational
            institution.

           23 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized by entering a
            health care facility.

           24 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized through
            imprisonment.

           25 This individual became main family nonresponse because the sample member
            contacted the study or IRB with a request to be removed from the study (sample
            individual is coded 15 for this wave).

           29 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, became institutionalized by some means other than the
            above; for example, he/she may have entered a religious order. Cases in which the
            type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           31 This sample member was unable to cooperate because of disability.

           32 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, was unable to cooperate because of disability.

           41 This individual died between the 2009 and 2011 interviews; this individual died
            after becoming nonresponse for some other reason before the 2009 interview.

           42 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
            persons and therefore has become nonsample.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no name or identifying
            information available

           58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
            the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

           59 Limited number of contacts attempted: miscellaneous office error (does not
            include codes 01-54 above or codes 91-99 below).

           60 This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer eligible to be interviewed.

           61 This nonsample individual was associated with a family containing a person
            erroneously designated as followable; the erroneous person's code is 45, 51, 53,
            54, or 60.

           80 Individual connected with the Latino sample (ER30001=7001-9308); this sample was
            dropped beginning in 1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample due
            to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped beginning in 1997.

           91 This individual moved out of the 2011 main family and was eligible to be
            followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 2011 main family and was not eligible to be followed.

           93 All sample members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual was
            nonsample and therefore became nonresponse.

           97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 2011 interview
            (ER34101>0 and ER34102=0); individual from Immigrant 17 sample
            (ER30001=4001-4462)

           98 This individual became main family or mover-out nonresponse by 2009 and was not
            selected for recontact in 2011 (ER34001=0 and ER34101=0 and ER34148=0 or
            ER34001>0 and ER34002=71-89 and ER34101=0 and ER34148=0).

           99 NA; DK

Total 2012 Family Money Income

The income reported here was collected in 2013 about tax year 2012. Please note that this variable can contain
negative values. Negative values indicate a net loss, which in waves prior to 1994 were bottom-coded at $1, as
were zero amounts. These losses occur as a result of business or farm losses.

This variable is the sum of these seven variables:

Annual Needs Standard for the 2012 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html. This is Table, 'Poverty Thresholds for 2012 by
Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years: 2012.' The threshold values are based on family
size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been
adjusted for changes in family composition during 2012. Please refer to Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993
PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation process.

ER58223  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade.

Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college (ER57680=8 or 9) or the
number of years of college is unknown (ER57683=8 or 9), then the value is 99. Otherwise, if Head attended
college (ER57680=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (ER57683). Otherwise, if
Head did not attend college, (ER57680=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER57669=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER57669=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER57672);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER57669=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER57677);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER57669=8 or 9), then the
value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head/Wife/"Wife". In cases where the Head has retained the
same designation of Head/Wife/"Wife" from the previous interview (ER57618=5), this variable has been carried
forward from previous years' data. If Head/Wife/"Wife" reports updated education and it is higher than
previously reported, then this variable is updated. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985 and 2009 and, as
of 2013, all returning Heads/Wives/"Wives" are asked for an updated education report every wave. Please refer to
variable Year Highest Education was Updated-Head (ER57667) for recency of updated education information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER34230 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED
but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER58245  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2013 ID number (ER53002) with the lowest value from
among the 2013 ID numbers (ER53002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for ER53002. The range of values is 1-8738, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

longer present at the time of the 2013 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2013 Head
also is coded 10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose

ER34230  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       13"

What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Heads/Wives/"Wives" and OFUMs aged 16 years or older who were in the Family
Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2013 interview.

The values for 2013 Heads/Wives/"Wives" are pulled from 2013 family-level data. Beginning in 2013, we asked for
an education update from our returning Heads/Wives/"Wives". If they report additional education attainment, then
we have updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the education
update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated", ER57557, for Wives/"Wives", and
ER57667, for Heads).

The values for 2013 OFUMs are derived from G90a1 (ER34219).

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER58223 (Head) and ER58224 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment
of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level
variable is the grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for OFUMs, this
variable differs from G90a1 (ER34219) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a GED (G90a2=2) but the value
derived from G90a1 is less than 12 years; that is, G90a1 retains the grade completed but the value for this
variable is coded as 12.

           4 Lost; unable to locate any member of the FU at all.

           5 FU is located too far away for interviewer contact.

           10 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. These individuals will

           14 This sample member was in jail or prison.

           15 Panel refusal by all all eligible/available FU members. Sample individual (or

            phone call to the 800#, or respondent-initiated phone call to the interviewer)
            with a strong request to be removed from the study.

           19 This sample member was in some other type of institution; for example, a
            religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included
            here, also.

           21 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or the
            Wife, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized by joining the
            armed forces.

           22 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, became institutionalized by entering an educational
            institution.

           23 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized by entering a
            health care facility.

           24 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or

```
           29 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, became institutionalized by some means other than the
            above; for example, he/she may have entered a religious order. Cases in which the
            type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

           31 This sample member was unable to cooperate because of disability.

           32 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, was unable to cooperate because of disability.

           41 This individual died between the 2011 and 2013 interviews; this individual died
            after becoming nonresponse for some other reason before the 2011 interview.

           42 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
            Wife, whichever is sample, died.

           45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
            persons and therefore has become nonsample.

           51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
            office error.

           52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

           53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
            this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

           54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

           57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no name or identifying
            information available

           58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
            the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

           59 Limited number of contacts attempted: miscellaneous office error (does not
            include codes 01-54 above or codes 91-99 below).

            dropped beginning in 1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample due
            to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped beginning in 1997.

           91 This individual moved out of the 2013 main family and was eligible to be
            followed, but the reason for nonresponse is NA.

           92 Individual moved out of the 2013 main family and was not eligible to be followed.

           93 All sample members of this FU united with other panel FUs; this individual was
            nonsample and therefore became nonresponse.

           97 This individual had not been born or moved in by the time of the 2013 interview
            (ER34201>0 and ER34202=0); individual from Immigrant 17 sample

Annual Needs Standard for the 2014 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/threshld/index.html. This is Table, 'Poverty Thresholds for 2014 by
Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years: 2014.' The threshold values are based on family
size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of the householder. This variable has been
adjusted for changes in family composition during 2014. Please refer to Section I, Part 5, of guide to the 1993
PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation process.

ER65459  "COMPLETED ED-HD "

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Head completed the eighth grade.

Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Head attended college (ER64832=8 or 9) or the
number of years of college is unknown (ER64835=8 or 9), then the value is 99. Otherwise, if Head attended
college (ER64832=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (ER64835). Otherwise, if
Head did not attend college, (ER64832=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER64821=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER64821=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER64824);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER64821=3), the value is the last grade finished
(ER64829);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER64821=8 or 9), then the
value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head/Spouse/Partner. In cases where the Head has retained the
same designation of Head/Spouse/Partner from the previous interview (ER64769=5), this variable has been carried
forward from previous years' data. If Head/Spouse/Partner reports updated education and it is higher than
previously reported, then this variable is updated. Education was reasked of all Heads in 1985 and 2009 and, as
of 2013, all returning Heads/Spouses/Partners are asked for an updated education report every wave. Please refer
to variable Year Highest Education was Updated-Head (ER64819) for recency of updated education information.

This variable differs from the individual level variableER34349 in the treatment of Heads who received a GED but
did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Heads is the grade completed; for the
individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER65481  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2015 ID number (ER60002) with the lowest value from
among the 2015 ID numbers (ER60002) of those families comprising each such household group. This value was used
in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family units who did
not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units were given
their own values for  ER60002. The range of values is 1-8738, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking
Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for
a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Note that these relationships are those to the 2013 Head for any individual whose 2015 sequence number (ER34302)

longer present at the time of the 2015 interview, his or her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 2015 Head
also is coded 10. Therefore, to select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose

ER34349  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       15"

What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Heads/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16 years or older who were in the Family
Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2015 interview.

The values for 2015 Heads/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2015 family-level data. Beginning in the 2013 Wave,
we asked for an education update for our returning Heads/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment
was reported, we updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the
education update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated", ER64680, for
Spouses/Partners, and ER64819, for Heads).

The values for 2015 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Heads/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS: uses variables
that correspond to the main education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m); for returning
Heads/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that correspond to the updated education series
(KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER65459 (Head) and ER65460 (Spouse/Partner) in the
treatment of Heads and Spouses/Partners who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the
family-level variable is the grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly,
for OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER34323) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a GED (G88b1=2) but
the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1 retains the grade completed but the value
for this variable is coded as 12.

  phone call to the 800#, or respondent-initiated phone call to the interviewer)
  with a strong request to be removed from the study.

19 This sample member was in some other type of institution; for example, a
  religious order. Cases in which the type of institution is unknown are included
  here, also.

21 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or the

  armed forces.

22 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
  Spouse, whichever is sample, became institutionalized by entering an educational
  institution.

23 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
  Spouse, whichever is the sample member, became institutionalized by entering a
  health care facility.

  the type of institution is unknown are included here, also.

31 This sample member was unable to cooperate because of disability.

42 This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse because the Head or
  Spouse, whichever is sample, died.

45 This individual was a sample member but has been adopted by unrelated nonsample
  persons and therefore has become nonsample.

51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
  office error.

52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;
  this record is the duplicate, or erroneous, one.

54 Listing error: this individual never existed or was not really living in the FU.

57 Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no name or identifying
  information available

58 Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff decided not to take all of
  the usual steps to try to locate and/or persuade this FU.

59 Limited number of contacts attempted: miscellaneous office error (does not
  include codes 01-54 above or codes 91-99 below).

Annual Needs Standard for the 2016 Family--CENSUS VERSION

This poverty threshold was taken from Census Bureau's website,
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html.
This is Table, 'Poverty Thresholds for 2016 by Size of Family and Number of Related Children Under 18 Years.'
The threshold values are based on family size, the number of persons in the family under age 18, and the age of
the householder.
This variable has been adjusted for changes in family composition during 2016. Please refer to Section I, Part
5, of guide to the 1993 PSID data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for further details about the generation process.

ER71538  "COMPLETED ED-RP "

Reference Person's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Reference Person completed the eighth grade.

Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Reference Person attended college (ER70904=8 or 9)
or the number of years of college is unknown (ER70907=8 or 9), then the value is 99. Otherwise, if Reference
Person attended college (ER70904=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended
(ER70907). Otherwise, if Reference Person did not attend college, (ER70904=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Reference Person is a high school graduate (ER70893=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Reference Person received a GED (ER70893=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER70896);

(c) if Reference Person neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER70893=3), the value is the last
grade finished (ER70901);

(d) if it is not known whether Reference Person graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER70893=8 or
9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Reference Person/Spouse/Partner. In cases where the Reference
Person has retained the same designation of Reference Person/Spouse/Partner from the previous interview
(ER70841=5), this variable has been carried forward from previous years' data. If Reference
Person/Spouse/Partner reports updated education and it is higher than previously reported, then this variable is
updated. Education was reasked of all Reference Persons in 1985 and 2009 and, as of 2015, all returning
Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are asked for an updated education report every wave. Please refer to
variable Year Highest Education was Updated-Reference Person (ER70891) for recency of updated education
information.

This variable differs from the individual level variableER34349 in the treatment of Reference Persons who
received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such Reference Persons is the
grade completed; for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

Spouse's/Partner's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 8 indicates that the
Spouse/Partner completed the eighth grade.

Values were computed as follows: If it is not known whether Spouse/Partner attended college (ER70766=8 or 9) or
the number of years of college is unknown (ER70769=8 or 9), then the value is 99. Otherwise, if Spouse/Partner
attended college (ER70766=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended (ER70769).
Otherwise, if Spouse/Partner did not attend college, (ER70766=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Spouse/Partner is a high school graduate (ER70755=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Spouse/Partner received a GED (ER70755=2), the value is the last grade finished (ER70758);

(c) if Spouse/Partner neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER70755=3), the value is the last grade
finished (ER70763);

(d) if it is not known whether Spouse/Partner graduated from high school, got a GED, or neither (ER70755=8 or

ER71560  "HOUSEHOLD ID # "

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units residing in the same
households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2017 ID number (ER66002) with the lowest value from
among the 2017 ID numbers (ER66002) of those families comprising each such household group.
This value was used in these file positions for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data
ordered by this variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other. Family
units who did not share their households with any other family unit or shared only with non-panel family units
were given their own values for  ER66002. The range of values is 1-8738, but the series is not contiguous. See
'Linking Data: Families Sharing Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data,
93GUIDE.PDF, for a discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

ER34503  "RELATION TO REFERENCE PERSON 17"

2017 Relationship to Reference Person

Note that these relationships are those to the 2015 Reference Person for any individual whose 2017 sequence
number (ER34502) is greater than 50; that is, individual has moved out of the FU. Thus, for example, if the
2015 Reference Person is no longer present at the time of the 2017 interview, his or her relationship to
Reference Person is coded 10; the new 2017 Reference Person also is coded 10. Therefore, to select current
Reference Persons, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence numbers (ER34502) are
coded 01.

ER34548  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       17"

What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16 years or older who were
in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of 08 indicates that
this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2017 interview.

The values for 2017 Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2017 family-level data. Beginning in the
2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners. If additional
educational attainment was reported, we updated their education variables in the background section and reported
the year of the education update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated", ER70753,
for Spouses/Partners, and ER70891, for Reference Persons).

The values for 2017 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS:
uses variables that correspond to the main education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m); for returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that correspond to the updated education series
(KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER71538 (Reference Person) and ER71539 (Spouse/Partner) in
the treatment of Reference Persons and Spouses/Partners who received a GED but did not attend college. The value
for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12.
Similarly, for OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER34522) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a GED
(G88b1=2) but the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1 retains the grade completed
but the value for this variable is coded as 12.

  persons and therefore has become nonsample.

51 This individual, although followed for interview, was discovered to be nonsample:
  office error.

52 This individual should have been followed but was not: office error.

53 This individual was mistakenly included in two or more response families at once;

                Non-comparability Notes Appendix

 F-b The 1972 wave has four codes for this variable that can be combined to produce
   comparable categories. Beginning in 1990, codes were added for recontact and
   Latino samples. Also, beginning in 1993, codes changed. See codebooks for
   specifics.

F-jj Background section variable, asked only of new Heads/Wives/"Wives". Data values
   for cases with same Heads/Wives/"Wives" as in the previous wave have been carried
   forward from the time when these persons most recently became new
   Heads/Wives/"Wives" or when the questions were reasked of all Heads/Wives/"Wives".
   Some of these variables may require updating. See the User Guide or the specific
   variable descriptions in the codebook. Note that for 1994-1996, 1999 and 2001,
   data have not been brought forward for same Heads and Wives/"Wives". In 1997, the
   background sections were rewritten to include a number of new questions; these and
   many familiar items were reasked of everyone. Education, sibling information, and
   years worked were, however, NOT reasked. Information was not brought forward from
   prior waves for these variables. However, from 2003 forward, the data are complete
   for everyone.

 F-m This is a bracket variable. If field amounts were coded in other years, they may
   be bracketed for comparability.

 F-n Coding structure and/or categories differ; see codebooks for details.

F-pp These variables are coded directly from Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaires, asked in
   1976 and 1985, and reported by Wives/"Wives" themselves.

 F-q This variable is one of two mentions coded from the responses or is a
   double-mention variable (a two-digit variable with the first digit equalling the
   data value for the first mention and the second equalling the data value for the
   second mention). Both first and second mention variables may or may not be
   priority coded. See codebooks for details.

 I-k Field width differs.

 I-m Codes for recontacts were included in this wave.
