**Overview of the**

**Child**

**Development**
**Supplement**



In the past several decades, there have been enormous demographic and
economic changes—some for better and some for worse—that have
altered the landscape for children and their families. Some of these
changes include: increased incidence of single-parent family structure,
declining social and economic conditions in many neighborhoods,
improvements in parental education, smaller family sizes, and increased
maternal employment. At the same time that such changes have been
taking place, public policy targeting families and children, especially
those at the bottom of the economic ladder, has also changed
fundamentally. At the time the CDS-I was initially fielded in 1997, the
U.S. had very limited nationally representative longitudinal studies of
children focusing on child health and development in the preadolescent
years. CDS was designed to increase our knowledge about how these and
other changes are influencing child development and well-being.


To address such a gap in knowledge, the CDS set out to fulfill the
objective of gathering comprehensive and nationally representative
information about children and their families to study how social,
economic, and other environmental factors affect children's and
adolescents’ development. The study addresses influences within the
context of families, schools, and neighborhoods, making it one of the
most comprehensive studies in the developmental field.


CDS is unique in the sense that it is a “supplement” to the PSID. CDS
combined with its parent study, the PSID, provide opportunities to study
the life course effects of circumstances and experiences in childhood and
adolescence on health, economic well being, and other life dimensions in
young adulthood and beyond.

**Background on**
**PSID**



The first wave of CDS was fielded in 1997 with funding from the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
The study collected information on up to two randomly selected 0-12 year
old children of PSID families, resulting in a total sample of about 3,600
children in roughly 2,400 families.


The second wave of the CDS was fielded in fall 2002-spring 2003. We
re-interviewed the same children from CDS-I, then ages 5-18 years of

age.


The third wave of the CDS fielded from fall 2007-spring 2008 will reinterview children currently ages 10-18, who have participated in either
CDS I or CDS II.


Much of the same information will be collected from parents and the
children, as well as data addressing issues relevant to the adolescent stage.
The content domains in CDS-III are broad, covering many topics in great
detail. Later in this manual, we will briefly describe these topics as we
outline each of the instruments.


This project will fill an important gap in data on children by
supplementing a high quality, national sample that already contains
almost 40 years of data on the families that it follows.


Welcome to the CDS!


_**The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID),**_ in its thirty-fifth wave of
data collection, is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of U.S.
men, women, children and the families in which they reside. Data on
employment, income, wealth, housing, food expenditures, transfer
income, and marital and fertility behavior have been collected annually or
bi-annually since 1968. From 5,000 families in 1968, the study has
grown to include over 8,500 families.


Most of the information collected is about family composition and
changes (marriages, divorces, births, deaths, people moving in and out),
income sources and amounts, employment, pensions and wealth. We also
ask about housing, education, vehicles, health, and money spent on food,
healthcare, and school. Our main focus is to learn how family
composition and financial factors interact with each other and how they
change over time.


The PSID sample is nationally representative—analysts can use the data
to draw conclusions about all families across the nation. The study is also
longitudinal—we go back to the same individuals and their families each
wave. What makes this data stand out from others dealing with the same


2


subjects is that we follow individuals over very long periods of time in
the context of their family settings, and we keep adding new generations
of our families to the study by following those who move away from the
main family we interview. These new cases are called split-offs. This is
the only way it’s possible to see changes over time and determine their
causes. And because we interview all eligible children of study families
when they become adults, researchers can examine trends across
generations of the same family.


Researchers from all over the world use PSID data to investigate
questions of income and expenditures, wealth, pensions, welfare, health,
marriage, divorce, child-bearing, aging, child development, education,
geographic mobility, housing, intergenerational effects, labor supply,
occupations, poverty, retirement, unemployment, and a host of other
topics.


With all this information about the study families, researchers can
analyze the effect of certain factors on others. For example, how does
divorce, health, or education level affect income? Does having moved
several times affect a child’s development? In addition, because we
interview adult children of sample members when they move out and
form their own households, analysts can study the ways in which the
circumstances and behaviors of one generation affect the opportunities
and behavior of the next.


The enormous usefulness of long-term economic and social data from a
national sample of families has made the PSID one of the most widely
used social science data in the world. No one else has interviewed two

and three generations of the same family or done it for such a long time.
Researchers know that changes in income, health and wealth are all
interconnected. To understand these changes, they need a study that
gathers information on all these topics, has a nationally representative
sample, and gathers the information from the same families each time.
The PSID is the only study _in the world_ that does all three of these things.


New in 2005 and repeated in 2007, is the addition of the Transition into
Adulthood (TA) study. The respondents for this cohort include those
CDS respondents who have aged out and are now 18-25 years of age.
This project began in August 2007, and is scheduled to end in December
2007.


The study is conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC), Institute
for Social Research (ISR), University of Michigan.

**Who Are the**
**Respondents?**



The respondents in the Child Development Study-III are families with
children ages 10 to 18 who completed a 2007 PSID interview and either the
1997 or 2002 Child Development Study. The following is a list of the types
of respondents you may find in each family. Please review carefully – it is
very important to understand the definition of the respondent types. There is
critical information here about Respondent Definitions and study preferences
for the identity of the primary caregiver and other caregiver (also please see
_Appendix C_ for additional information on this topic).


**THE CHILD**
Up to two children, ten to eighteen years old, per Family Unit (FU) are
eligible for inclusion in this study. Therefore, it is possible to have some
children in a household who are not eligible for inclusion in this study.
Children have been pre-selected for eligibility based on past participation in
the CDS and in the 2007 PSID interview.


**PRIMARY CAREGIVER (PCG)**
The Primary Caregiver is the main respondent for this study, and will be
completing the Coverscreen, signing permission forms, helping you schedule
interviews with the child, completing an interview about the child and about
the household environment, and in some cases, completing the time diaries for
or with the child. By definition, the PCG **must live with the child** .


In most cases, the **PCG** will be the **child’s biological mother** . If the
biological mother is not living with the child, the appropriate respondent is the
first person on the following list who lives with the child:


1. Stepmother, Adoptive mother, or Foster Mother
2. Other female **legal** guardian (must be at least 18 years of age)
3. Father (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)
4. Male legal guardian of the target child
5. **Final preference** is to take the interview from the person living with
the child who is an adult (at least 18 years of age or older) and takes
primary responsibility for caring for the child. This might be another
relative such as a grandmother or aunt. This does not include someone
who is paid or hired to take care of the child (i.e., not a babysitter or
nanny).


We have preloaded the likely PCG based on data from CDS-II (2002) and the
2007 PSID core interview. It is important to verify who the PCG is at this
time because that person may have changed since we interviewed the family
last. Do not make assumptions about the identity of the PCG – the
Coverscreen will guide you through the selection process.


If the primary caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the
Interviewer will administer separate PCG interviews for each child.


6


**OTHER CAREGIVER (OCG)**
The Other Caregiver is another adult in the household (usually the child's
father, or the mother's spouse/partner) who also has responsibility for raising
the child. Once you have determined who the actual PCG will be for this
family, you will ask the PCG if there is another caregiver in the household
who has responsibility for raising the child. There will be households that **do**
**not** have an OCG. By definition, the OCG **must live with the child** and
**must be at least 18 years of age** .


In most cases, the **OCG** will be the **child’s biological father** . If the
biological father is not living with the child, the appropriate respondent is the
first person on the following list who lives with the child (and is not the
PCG):


1. **Father** (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)
2. **Grandmother** of the target child
3. **Boyfriend or Girlfriend** of the primary caregiver
4. **Other Relative** of child who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living
in the HU. If there is more than one in the HU, choose the person who
has the most responsibility for taking care of the target child.
5. **Other Non-relative** who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in
the HU. If there is more than one in the HU, choose the person who has
the most responsibility for taking care of the target child. This should
not be a paid employee (i.e., not a babysitter or nanny).


The Other Caregiver **must** be over 18 years of age for all definitions.


If the other caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the OCG will
complete an interview for each child.


**INTERVIEWER!**
You are also a respondent in this study. The Interviewer reports on
observations about the respondents and their interactions. These observations
are recorded in call notes and in the Interviewer Observations at the end of the

Interviewer administered questionnaires.

**PART B: OVERVIEW OF INTERVIEWER TASKS**


**General** This section is designed to orient the Field Interviewer to the process
involved in the Child Development Supplement. The large number of
components in this study makes it important to pay attention to the details
of setting up, administering, and completing the interviews. Below is a list
of procedures used in processing a household case and the preferred order
of administration. We understand that not all interviews can be completed
in this order; however, we have found that in general the interviews go
more smoothly when this order can be followed.



**Review Your**
**Sample**


**Pre-Contact**

**Letters**


**Contact the**

**Household**


**Complete the**
**Coverscreen**



Take the time to review the information on each sample line and read the
profiles for each case. This will help you decide the order in which to
contact your cases and the best approaches to use in each case.


You also need to prioritize your sample based on location. If you have two
sample lines close together, it makes sense to try and economize on travel
by scheduling them on the same day, if possible. You may also find a few
cases where you have two sample lines in the same household (cases where
families have moved in together). You would definitely want to schedule
these together, if at all possible.


You will receive pre-contact letters in your bulk materials. You should
mail the letters to each household as you work your sample. It is important
to send out the letters in measured quantities and intervals to provide
sufficient sample to work efficiently throughout the field period. The
letters will remind respondents that their family has participated in CDS in
the past and will ask for their participation again. The letters will let
respondents know that an Interviewer will be calling them to make an
appointment for a household visit to conduct the interview with the primary
caregiver and the CDS children. We hope that the pre-contact letters will
help in gaining cooperation for the Interviewer's initial contact with the
household.


Once you have sent the pre-contact letter and allowed time for it to reach
the household, you are ready to contact the household. In order to complete
the Coverscreen, you must first locate one of the children and speak to the
primary caregiver of the child.


After you have located at least one of the CDS children in the household,
you will complete the Coverscreen Blaise instrument. In this interview,
you will verify the household members and study respondents.


You will also describe the details of what the interview will involve and set

up an appointment time for an in-person interview. It is important to fully
explain what will be expected of the household members that have been
selected to be interviewed.


It is very important that the Coverscreen is completed correctly. The
information contained here determines how many sample lines will be
spawned for the case.


After talking to and confirming all of the appropriate information with the
primary caregiver, send the Interview Packet, which includes:


  - An introduction letter

  - Paper time diaries (2 per child)

  - PCG/OCG Respondent Booklets (if needed)


You should fill in the respondent's names and appointment information on
the introduction letter before sending it to the household. You may do the
PCG and OCG interviews by phone before you visit the household. If you
decide to do this, you should include a PCG or OCG Respondent Booklet
in the Interview Packet that you send to the household. Otherwise, you can
provide them when you visit the household. In your bulk supplies you will
have envelopes large enough to send all the required documents, as well as
stamps. You will send the packets via the U.S. Postal Service.


Once the PCG has received the Interview Packet, including the Respondent
Booklet, you may complete the PCG Interview by telephone, which is the
preferred mode. If possible, you should complete this interview before
going to the household to complete the Child interview.


This step involves actually setting up the materials for the household. Your
bulk materials will include the materials you will need to complete your
household cases. You must determine what materials this household will

need and organize them.


You will be provided with clear plastic envelopes in which to store the
materials for each case when visiting the household. These are large
enough to fit all the necessary material for a household visit. Assemble all
of the materials for each case and keep it organized and safe in this
envelope. You should take the envelope with you to each household visit
and have it close at hand whenever you contact the household by telephone.


When you first arrive at the home, you will need to obtain written
permission from both the parent and children in order to conduct the Child
interview. For CDS-III, these consent forms will be on the tablet computer
and will require electronic signatures _. Chapter 3: Informed Consent_

explains more about the permission forms. In general:


When you visit the household, you need to obtain a permission form signed
by a parent or legal guardian for each child **before** starting the Child CAPI
interview/assessments or before any attempt to contact the children
themselves to set an appointment. In addition, each child will be asked to
sign an interview _assent_ form before they take part in the assessments or
CAPI interview.


You will also be asked to collect a little information from the PCG

regarding the Child’s school at the very beginning of the Child interview.


While at the household, you will interview each selected child and review
the time diaries. You may also interview the PCG or OCG if not
previously done by phone. Remember, it is acceptable to interview the PCG
or OCG later by phone. You should not plan a return face-to-face visit just
to complete the PCG or OCG interviews, but just follow up on the phone.


When planning your contacts with a given household, be strategic. You will
want to be as efficient as possible so to reduce burden on both the
respondents and yourself. Attempt to do as much with the primary
caregiver and other caregiver by telephone as you can. Prioritize the
activities that absolutely need to be done in person for your household visit.
There is more information in _Section V: Administering the Overall Process_
and _Section VI: Field Notes_ about tips and strategies for working through
the various components of the study.


As soon as possible after the Child interview is complete and after you have
left the household, you will complete the Interviewer observations section
in Blaise. Notify your team leader that you have completed the household
visit and report your progress with the interview. Keep all completed
materials together in an envelope or folder to make sure they do not get
lost.


If you have not already done so, you will complete the OCG Interview by
telephone, the preferred mode.


Once all of the components of the entire Child Development Supplement
household case have been completed, double-check them for completeness
and report to your Team Leader that you have finished the case. The
completed time diaries should be sent via UPS to Ann Arbor in the UPS
letter envelopes that are included in your bulk supplies.  Be sure to use the
pre-printed labels that were sent with your supplies and include the study
name and your interviewer number. You will also need to record the
tracking number in the Control Tab which is part of the View/Edit group of
tabs in SurveyTrak.

SECTION II: SURVEYTRAK


**PART A: SURVEYTRAK INSTRUCTIONS**


**SurveyTrak** SurveyTrak is the sample management system you will use to help
manage your work on the CDS. The basics of the SurveyTrak program
are described in the **SurveyTrak Manual** . SurveyTrak is a very robust
program and the SurveyTrak manual includes descriptions of the how to
navigate in the program and information on more advanced features.


This section of the CDS Project Manual describes the SurveyTrak features
unique to the CDS.



**Introduction to**

**the CDS**
**SurveyTrak**
**Project Design**



There will be three CDS projects in SurveyTrak.


  - **Training Directory** : This contains the training sample lines that
you will use during in person training. Additional lines for
individual practice have also been supplied in this project. You
will be provided with a list of practice IDs that are available to use.
There will also be a stand alone application for practice with the
cognitive assessments.

  - **Certification Directory** : This project contains lines that will be
used to conduct scripted certification interviews. Certification
lines are not to be used for any other purposes.

  - **Production Directory** : This contains your production sample.
You will use this project when you contact or attempt to contact a
Coverscreen line.


The first thing you’ll notice when you enter SurveyTrak is the
appointments/projection window that opens _(see figure 2.A.1)._ The top
portion of the window shows any appointments and any information that
you may have entered into the planner. The bottom portion of the window
is for you to project the hours that will work on any project that you may
currently have in SurveyTrak. This is a new feature of SurveyTrak and
you will learn more about how we use it at training.

**:**


The second thing you'll notice when you enter one of the CDS
SurveyTrak projects is that the desi gn of SurveyTrak is new. There are
actually three group types (studies) inside the one CDS SurveyTrak
project. Those projects are Screener, CDS and TA _(see Figure 2.A.2}._
(There is also an All Final tab that will contain finalized cases from any of
the study paits you may work on).


12


Each one of those group tabs has a regular set of SurveyTrak tabs
associated with it. The Sample, Address, Transfer, Transfer History and
Finalized Tabs will display the information for the group tab that is
currently active. To tell which group is active you can look at the Sample,
Address, Transfer, Transfer History and Finalized Tabs and the group type
active should be before the name of the tab _(see Figure 2.A.3)_


For our purposes here, we will only focus on the CDS group (project).


Another striking feature of this new design of SurveyTrak is that it will
spawn individual lines based on the information you collect at the
household level in the Coverscreen Blaise interview. When you first
receive your sample you will see one line per household (xxxx-xxxHH1).
Once you complete the Coverscreen for that line, the following lines will
be created (xxxx-xxx represents the Sample ID).


  - xxxx-xxxHH1PCG1 line – for accessing the telephone interview
for the Primary Caregiver

  - xxxx-xxxHH1CH1 line – for accessing the face-to-face child
interview (including the Woodcock-Johnson assessments)

  - xxxx-xxxHH1OCG1 line – for accessing the telephone interview
for the Other Caregiver

  - xxxx-xxxTD1 line – for managing the status and mailing of the
weekday and weekend Time Diaries.


If there are two children in the household, additional lines for that child
will be created (PCG2, CH2, OCG2, TD2). And if the second child lives
in another household, a second Coverscreen will be created.


As you probably realize by now, managing the CDS-III sample will be a
complex task. Here we will go over a few basics and the details of the
SurveyTrak system that makes this possible.

Case Notes:


Fi gu re 2.A.3


**CDS Tabs** The CDS project will be pre-loaded with lines for households having a CDS eligible
child - that is, children cmTently 10-18 years old who paiiicipated in CDS in 1997 or
2002. There is one Coverscreen line loaded for each household. After completing
the Coverscreen, SmveyTrak will generate the appropriate lines based on the
info1mation you have entered. A Coverscreen can generate up to nine additional
lines.


The CDS tabs are used to track your work in contacting the respondents and to
access the vai·ious Blaise questionnaires. You will enter a call record for each
contact attempt, selecting the mode of contact, result code, entering a telephone
number if applicable, date and time of appointment if there is one, and a description
of the contact attempt.

When you complete an inte1view with a respondent, the final completed result code
is automatically assi gn ed by SmveyTrak. Once you complete all Call Wizard actions
for that line, it is transferred to the finalized tab. Your work with the line is
complete, but the sample line will remain in your computer under the finalized tab
until all of the related lines have been completed. Once the other lines have been
completed they will be pulled from your laptop.


Most of the tabs and columns in SmveyTrak for the CDS project ai-e standard. There
ai·e some unique items for the CDS.


14


From left to right, the columns in the top pane of the Sample Line Tab are:


**RC Ind -** This field indicates refusal conversion cases.


**Sample ID -** The ID number for the sample line.


**Result Code -** The result code of the most recent call.


**Result Date -** Date of the most recently recorded result code.


**IW Status -** If this field is blank, it means that the interview has not been started.
Otherwise, this field will indicate whether the case is complete or suspended.


**Wizard Actions -** Indicates whether or not the relevant Wizards have been

completed.


**Sample Type** - Indicates the type of line (PCG, OCG, Child, Time Diary). This is
to be used when you want to sort all of a particular sample type together.


**HH Obs Priority** - This flag indicates which PCG has the priority to receive the
household observations.


**Tel Calls -** Shows how many calls have been made on the case.


**Face to Face -** The number of face-to-face contact attempts for the case.


**Last Call Mode -** Indicates the mode of the most recent result code.


**6** **[th]** **Call No Contact** - Indicates that 6 consecutive calls were made to a HH and no

contact was made.


**Contact Obs Sum Status** – Indicates the status of Contact Observations (complete,
incomplete, null)


**Iwer Obs Status** – Indicates the status of Iwer Observations (complete, suspended,
null)


**Letter Status** - Indicates the status of the letter requested.


**Rel # -** Indicates which release the sample line was in.


**Language** - This flag is set during the Coverscreen if the PCG speaks Spanish.


**Weekday Diary -** Indicates the weekday that was selected for the time diary. This
information is only on the time diary line that is generated.


**Weekend Diary -** Indicates the weekend day that was selected for the time diary.
This information is only on the time diary line that is generated.

**Time Diaries**


**Call Info CDS{TA/SCR**



During the completion of the CDS Coverscreen a weekday and a
weekend day will be randomly selected for the child to complete a
time diary. You will mail the time diaries in advance and you pick
them up at the time of the face-to-face interview. You may need to
follow up with the child to complete the time diaiy, so a time diaiy
line is generated in SurveyTrak to record all info1mation related to
completion and return of the time diaries. There is no Blaise
interview connected to this line, so the IW button is disabled. If
you mistakenly click the IW button you will receive a message that

says:


_"There is no interview connected to this line._ "


As you continue to work to get the time diai·ies completed and
returned, conta.ct attempts will be entered and tracked through the
call wizai·d _(see Figure 2.A.9)._ You will be asked to record the
status of each diary. There is a status for the weekday diary and
one for the weekend diaiy. The status for each diary will be blank
when recording the first call attempt. At each contact, you will
update the sta.tus to either pending or complete depending on the
outcome of your contact. The time diaiy line is considered
complete when both time diaries (weekday and weekend) have
been assigned a status of complete. If either of the diai·ies is
pending, the time diaiy line has a suspended status.

**Permission Forms and**
**Electronic Signatures**



We will be using the Fujitsu tablet PC to capture electronic
signatures to document informed consent and receipt of cash tokens
of appreciation. You will not be able to access a child interview
until both the Parent Permission and the Child Assent forms have

been signed.


Consent Forms

You will access the appropriate forms via the Permission Forms tab
within the View/Edit menu.  You will select the type of form you
need (parent/guardian, minor) and the form will open using a
software package called Journal. The area for the respondent or
parent/guardian to fill out is at the bottom of the form and he or she
will use the stylus just like a regular ink pen to complete the
necessary information. Once the signature has been obtained, you
can close the document by clicking on the X in the upper right hand
corner. When you close the document, a series of messages will

pop up:


  - First, you will be prompted to save the document.

  - Next, you will be asked to verify that a signature was
obtained.

  - Then asked to confirm the date and time of signature.


SurveyTrak stores the form with a date and time stamp and on your
next send/receive to Ann Arbor, we receive a copy of the signed
electronic form for our files.


Payment Receipt Form
The payment receipt form is in an electronic format rather than a
paper document. The respondents have the option of being paid by
check or with cash. These questions are a part of the Blaise
instrument. If the respondent would like to be paid by check,
project staff will handle this request. No payment receipt form is
needed if a respondent would like to be paid by check.


If the respondent prefers to be paid in cash, a payment receipt form
is required. SurveyTrak checks against the Blaise payment
questions to see if the payment receipt form is required. If a
payment receipt form is required, it will be accessible to be signed
after the interview has been completed. SurveyTrak will direct you
to the Payment Receipt Form tab and functions in the same manner
as the consent/assent forms discussed earlier.


You MUST get a signed receipt if you give a respondent a cash
payment. This is the receipt that will be used to reconcile your
expenses in Tenrox.


20


**Completing**
**Observations**


**Follow-Up Letter**
**Requests**



In addition to the call records you make in SurveyTrak, the
observations you complete during your work in the field provide
important details about the status of your cases. In the CDS, there
are two types of observations:


  - Contact Observations

  - Interviewer Observations for Coverscreen and Child

Interview


SurveyTrak will bring up the observations to fill out at the
appropriate time, based on result codes.


_**Contact Observations**_ are completed the first time you make
contact with a household and on every refusal with the household.
If the line is a time diary line the contact observations are only
required when a resistance result code is assigned. They will come
up one more time after an interview has been completed. These
observations are triggered by the entry of a result code indicating
contact was made (for example, an appointment was set).  There
are two contact observation questions related to respondent

concerns.


_**Interviewer Observations**_ are only made for all completed CDS
Coverscreens and Child Interviews. You will be asked to provide
any information about the Coverscreen that may help us understand
any confusing or unusual family situations. There is only one
open-ended question and you should be as thorough as possible in
completing it. The more extensive interviewer observations appear
after you have completed the child interview. They are to be
completed only after you have left the household. They consist of
brief questions about assessments you administered to the child
during the interview, questions about the PCG and about the
interview and household (conditions of the house). You will also
answer questions about your observations of how the PCG and the
child interacted while you were in the household, if applicable.


You will be able to request follow-up letters through the Letters
module in SurveyTrak. You can access the Letters module from
the Edit menu.


The following are available for request.


Sympathy Payment Problem
Refusal/Resistance Hard to Reach

No Phone More Info

Confidentiality


21


**Interview Probability** Later in the study period (at which time you will hear more about it
on a team conference call), you will be asked to record the
likelihood the sample line will result in a completed interview
(1001) by the end of the study. This option will become active
when you assign an initial resistance (4300 series) result code.
Later on we may add additional result codes that will trigger the
interview probability questions to come up. The probability values
will be:


1= High
2= Medium

3= Low


The rating is recorded within the Call Wizard.


**Level of Resistance** When a result code indicating informant/respondent concerns
(4300 and 5000 series) is assigned you will be asked to rate the
level of resistance. The rating scale is:


1 = High
2 = Medium

3 = Low


The rating is recorded within the Call Wizard.

**PART B: RESPONDENT PROFILES**


**Overview** The Respondent Profile (Profile) is an option that stores and
displays certain information about a study family that has been
gathered in previous waves.


**Important Note** Information in the Profile is _**strictly confidential**_ and should be
viewed only by the interviewer. It cannot be printed.


**Viewing Profiles** The Profile cannot be open in SurveyTrak at the same time as the
interview.


To view a Profile for a particular Sample ID, select the Sample ID
on the Sample Line or Address tab. From the SurveyTrak drop
down list select “Profile”. This will open a window containing
detailed information about the selected line. To view all the

information, use the scroll bar on the right. To exit the profile, click
on the “X” in the upper right-hand corner of the window.


**Included information** **Case identifiers** —Sample ID, address, phone and last wave’s
family listing


**Past problems** —any IW problems, whether a persuasion letter was
sent, the type of letter and the letter text


**Iwer Notes** —The Iwer’s observations, and call notes from both
2007 PSID and 2002 CDS


**Contact info** —The 2007 Contact and Finder Information


**Some Explanations** **Interview type—** Whether the case was a Reinterview, Splitoff or
Recontact in PSID.


**Persuasion letter sent** —This lets you know that we wrote to the
family the previous wave. It could be a sympathy letter, a payment
problem letter, a hard to reach letter, or a genuine persuasion letter.


**Letter text** —The text of the letter (or letters, if more than one was
sent) is also included.


**Missing information** —Some information (such as the relationship
for contact people, proxies, etc.) won’t appear if it wasn’t obtained
by the previous wave’s Iwer.

SECTION III: CDS QUESTIONNAIRES


_**CHAPTER 1: COVERSCREEN**_


**PART A: SUMMARY NOTES FOR COVERSCREEN**


**Respondent** Primary Caregiver (preferred) or any adult living in the household.



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Telephone/CAI in Blaise



**Main Objective** The Coverscreen is used to verify information about the preloaded CDS
children and determine who their PCG’s and OCG’s are in order for the

program to generate the appropriate sample lines for each respondent. In
addition, within the Coverscreen the program generates randomly the
Time Diary days for each child.


**Notes and Rules** The Coverscreen is the only line preloaded for each household in the
sample. Since it’s used to obtain information that determines the
respondents as well as the structure and flow of all the other portions of
the interview, it must be completed before any of the lines for all of the
other components of the case are spawned. This is why it is extremely
important that it gets completed accurately. The consequences of
entering wrong information in the Coverscreen are long and costly:


              - Interviewing FU’s where the CDS child is actually ineligible

              - Not interviewing a FU where the CDS child is eligible

              - Interviewing the wrong PCG or OCG

              - Passing bad data to subsequent interviews

              - The age and grade of the CDS child determine many, many skip
patterns in all of the interviews


Before you begin the Coverscreen, you must verify that you are
speaking to the primary caregiver of at least one of the CDS children, or
an adult who lives in the household, AND that at least one of the CDS
eligible children lives in the household.


Within the program there are two checkpoints (confirmation screens) to
assist you in preventing the wrong lines being spawned. The first is right
after you confirm or update the preloaded information. You are asked to
do a review and make final changes. The second checkpoint is at the


27


end of the Coverscreen where we list all the sample lines that will be
generated when you complete the interview and ask you to verify that it
is correct. If you are unsure whether the information is correct, you need
to suspend the interview and consult with your TL. If you know that the
sample lines about to be spawned are incorrect, you will suspend the
interview and RESTART it.


At the end of the Coverscreen you need to make (or at least attempt to
make) all appointments for the interviews within the household--PCG,
Child, OCG. You will be given a planner to assist you in arranging all
your appointments.


28


TOC


**PART B: DETAILS ON THE COVERSCREEN**


**Introduction** Introduce yourself and ask to speak to the person who is assumed, based
on information from previous PSID interviews, to be the PCG. This
person's name will be preloaded into SurveyTrak. Explain that you are
calling about the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development
Study and remind the PCG that the family has participated in PSID and
CDS in the past. **You must find at least one of the CDS children**
**before you begin the Coverscreen.** The introduction screen in the
Coverscreen itself is a suggested phone introduction. You are not required
to read it verbatim. We strongly encourage all Interviewers to tailor their
introduction using the information provided during training and in this
reference manual. You will have time to practice this introduction at
training.


**Household List** The household will be preloaded with the names of expected CDS
children as well as all other individuals listed as living in the household at
the end of the PSID 2007 interview. However, you will need to confirm
that each CDS child is still living in the household. If a child on this list
has moved away from the household, the Coverscreen will guide you
through the appropriate questions that will determine whether the child is
still eligible to participate in the CDS study, and the subsequent path to
follow, depending on why the child has moved away.


In updating the household list you will ask about each individual prelisted
and whether they are still living in this household or have moved out. For
each individual you will ask their name, age, and relationship to the CDS
child. In addition you will ask and list all other individuals who have
moved into this household and were not preloaded. Each prelisted
individual--CDS children and all others--will be assigned a status code.


To indicate the status of each person in the household you will use one of
the following status codes:


            - FU member (see Appendix H for more information)

            - Living with someone else. _**Used for CDS Children only.**_

            - Moved out on (his/her) own

            - Died

            - Jail

            - Military

            - Education

            - Health

            - Other Institutional


Depending on the status code assigned to the CDS child, and the follow up
questions, we will determine whether the child is still eligible to


29


**Child Information**

**Update**



participate in the study or not. For example, if the child has moved out and
is now living with someone else, he or she is still eligible to participate in
CDS. If this is the only CDS eligible child you will suspend the
Coverscreen and contact the household where the child is now living and
conduct the interview with an adult living in that household. If there are
two CDS children in the household and one has moved out, upon
completing the Coverscreen SurveyTrak will spawn a new household line
that will have SID extension HH2.


**Child Eligibility Flag**


After the S **tatus** for each preloaded CDS child is assigned and all follow
up questions are completed, the program will assign an eligibility flag to
the children. The additional information considered to determine the child
eligibility are **Age and Grade** (if still in school). The eligibility flag will
be used to either continue with the interview or advise you that you have
no eligible children to interview and need to code the case appropriately.
You will run across situations that you may be unclear why a child is
determined as ineligible. In these cases you should **suspend the**
**Coverscreen and contact your TL immediately** to get advice on how to
proceed.


In general we will consider as eligible to interview children that fall into
the following categories:


ELIGIBLE IF:


1) In FU
2) Living with Someone Else (create second HH)
3) In the Military
4) Away at School


NOT ELIGIBLE IF:


1) In Jail
2) In Health Institution
3) In Other institution
4) Moved Out on his/her own


The Coverscreen will display preloaded information about each CDS child
in the household including name, gender, date of birth and grade attending
in school. Confirm the spelling of the name and all other information.

**Identify “Primary**
**Caregiver”**


**Identify “Other**
**Caregiver”**



The Coverscreen questions will guide you through the selection of the
primary caregiver. Most likely you will be talking to that person, but it is
necessary to ask each question as listed. The respondent may say that
there are two adults who take care of the child equally; see Appendix D
for guidelines on determining the PCG.


If there are two CDS children in the household you will ask the OCG
questions for each child. Most of the times the same PCG will be listed for
both children, but it is possible that there will be two CDS children in the
same household who each have a different PCG.


Again the Coverscreen questions will guide you through the selection of
the other caregiver. You will be asking if there is another person, age 18
or older, living with the child who helps take care of the child; see
Appendix D for guidelines on determining the OCG. You will also need
to confirm the OCG's name and relationship to the child for each child.



**Incentive Payment** After you have verified who the primary caregiver and other caregiver are
you will begin the process of explaining the interview and setting up an
appointment for each respondent. We have found that it is usually most
effective to mention the incentive payment at this time, but it is acceptable
to mention the payment earlier in the introduction if the respondent is
expressing reluctance and you feel payment would make them more
willing to continue.


For CDS-III, the PCG will be sent a check of $75 upon completion of the
PCG interview(s) (not the Coverscreen), the OCG will be sent a check of
$20 upon completion of the OCG interview(s), and each child will be sent
a check for $40 after completion of the Child interview. You should be
prepared to pay the child in cash, since you will be face to face for that
interview.


Note: if there are two children in the household, the PCG and OCG will
only receive one payment each even if they do two interviews, one for
each child. This will be paid upon completion of their first interview.


**Time Diary** You will need to explain to the PCG that you will be sending two time
diaries for each CDS child to fill out prior to the household visit. Since
the time diary is a very important part of this study, it is essential that you
introduce the diary in a way that encourages the primary caregiver to
assist the CDS Child to fill the diaries out completely and carefully. Use
the script on the screen as a guide, and come up with an explanation that
you feel comfortable with and that motivates your respondents to do as
good a job as possible with the diaries.


31


**Set Appointment**
**Time for the Child**

**Interview**


**Mail Interview**

**Packet**



Blaise will randomly assign a weekday and a weekend day for the time
diaries. If there are two children in the household, the time diaries will
need to be filled out on the same days for both children. Make a note of
the days of the interview, weekday diary, and weekend day diary. You
should ask the PCG to have the child complete the time diaries
themselves, as much as possible. Only if needed should the PCG assist
them.


There are several things to keep in mind when setting up the appointment
for the Child Interview (face-to-face).


  - Try to set an appointment time when the primary caregiver and
(both) child(ren) will be home so you can do the interview(s) in
one visit if possible.


  - Tell the respondent about how long the interviews will take, to
make sure that you have sufficient time to do the interview during
the visit. If necessary, make sure the respondent understands that if
there are two CDS children in the household, there will be a PCG
and OCG interview for each child.


  - Make sure the respondent understands that you will be
interviewing him/her and the child(ren) selected for the study, and
that either the PCG or OCG has to be present to sign the consent
and that an adult (over 18) has to be there throughout the Child
Interview. Also make sure they understand that you will be
sending Time Diaries that should be filled out before you come for
the interview appointment.


  - Note that you will also set up a time for the PCG and OCG
interviews at this time, allowing time for them to receive the
Interview Packet containing the Respondent Booklets.


Remind the PCG that you will be mailing an Interview Packet to the
household containing an introductory letter, the time diaries and
respondent booklets (if necessary). Verify and update the PCG's address
in SurveyTrak. After you have set up the appointment, mail the Interview
Packet.



**Call Records** Every contact attempt should be recorded in the call records. Because you
will be working with different households at one time and it may take
several contacts to set up and complete a household case, good call notes
will be essential for this study.


Include in your call notes a brief description of every contact with the


32


household, including any unusual circumstances that you should keep in
mind for the household visit or that a future Interviewer might wish to be
aware of.


Notes about unusual custody arrangements, suggestions for best times to
make contact, notes about the extracurricular activities of the child(ren), or
other helpful hints to the next Interviewer should be included here.


Notes about unusual situations that might affect the data should be
included in the Interviewer Observations for the case.

PART A: SUMMARY NOTES FOR THE PCG INTERVIEW


**Respondent** Primary Caregiver (PCG), as designated in the Coverscreen.


**Color of Booklet** Blaise instrument, Pink RB



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Telephone preferred; face-to-face optional.
The PCG interview should be administered before the Child interview. If

necessary, it _can be administered_ over the phone _after_ the home visit.



**Main Objective** To obtain information from the primary caregiver about the child and the
family environment. The PCG is a **PRIORITY INTERVIEW** .


**Notes and Rules** There is one line for each PCG interview in a household. If there is only
one CDS eligible child in the household, then there will only be one
sample line for the PCG.


The PCG interview contains questions centered on the targeted CDS
youth, as well as questions concerning the PCG’s psychological resources,
parenting attitudes and beliefs, social support, and interactions with the
other caregiver, and home environment.


Each PCG will complete a series of household level questions. If there
two CDS children in one household, these will only be asked once from
the PCG. A priority flag is assigned to indicate which of the two PCG
interviews will launch the HH questions. For the priority PCG interview,
the household level questions will be asked first, and then the child
specific questions will follow. The priority interview containing the
household level questions should always be completed first.



**Overview of the**

**Instrument**



We obtain information from the PCG on:


  - Children’s health history

  - Children’s schooling

  - Children’s behavior

  - Child care history

  - Relationship with absent parent (if applicable)

  - Expenditures on the child

  - Child’s activities and hobbies

  - Characteristics of the family’s neighborhood

  - Characteristics of the primary caregiver

**Section J:**

**PCG – HH level**
**questions**


**Section A:**

**Health**


**Section B:**
**Schooling**



The HH level questions are only asked once per household. If there are
two CDS children/adolescents with the same primary caregiver, the PCGHH module will only be asked once between the two PCG interviews
(PCG1 and PCG2). One of the PCG interviews will be assigned a priority
flag to designate the household level questions. You should complete this
interview first.


The PCG-HH module focuses on the social environment of the child.

Starting at the broadest level, we ask a number of questions about the
neighborhood, such as length of time lived in the neighborhood,
neighborhood satisfaction, perceptions of safety, and social cohesion. We
also ask about the family’s participation in the community or
neighborhood, such as participation in church, community institutions like
the YMCA, scouting, and neighborhood organizations.


We are interested in knowing a little bit about the family environment as
well. We ask about the distribution of household responsibilities among
household members, life style adjustments parents sometimes make to
improve their children’s lives, experiences of economic or financial stress
and strain and practical responses to such financial pressures, and media
use and household rules about use of such media as TVs, computers, and

games.


Finally, we want to know a little bit about the primary caregivers
themselves. For example, we ask about attitudes towards the father role,
maternal work, and non-parental childcare; self-esteem; psychological
distress; work schedules, and social support.


In Section A, we ask the primary caregiver a detailed series of questions
about the child’s/adolescent’s health, including hospitalizations, chronic
conditions, asthma, health care utilization, and health care coverage.


In Section B, we ask a number of questions about the child’s/adolescent’s
school enrollment and primary caregiver’s expectations about the
child’s/adolescent’s schooling. We are also interested in grade level, type
of school (private/public), frequency of school changes, school tuition,
attendance, receipt of meals under the school lunch and breakfast
programs, attendance at special class or school for gifted students, or
whether the child/adolescent was classified as needing special education.


We also ask the primary caregivers about their involvement in the child's
school, including meeting or conversing with the child's/adolescent’s
teacher, school principal, or school counselor; attendance at a school event

or the parent-teacher's association meeting; and volunteer work in the

In the Child Care Section, we inquire about the type, frequency of use, and
costs of all formal and informal arrangements.


We have a series of questions in Section D that focus on the
child’s/adolescent’s interaction with an absent parent, including the
frequency and types of activities in which absent parents are involved with
their children.


We also ask about the degree of conflict and/or agreement between the
parent the child lives with and the absent parent over issues such as where
the child lives, how he or she is raised, visits, discipline, etc.


Section E contains questions about family activities, such as frequency of
parents engaging in indoor and outdoor activities with child or adolescent,
family get-togethers, and eating meals together.


Sections F, G, and H are all about hobbies, after-school activities, and
community activities. At the end of H are a series of questions about
expenditures and savings. You will ask these questions regarding all
children/adolescents in the study.

_CHAPTER 3: INFORMED CONSENTS_


**PART A: INFORMED CONSENT OVERVIEW**



**Introduction to**

**Informed Consent**

**Procedures**



Informed consent is the term given to the communication process that
allows individuals to make an informed choice about participation in a
research study. This process is reflected in an informed consent document
that contains specific, required information about the research study. The
informed consent document serves as the formal authorization by an
individual of their agreement to participate in the proposed research.


The human subjects in your project must participate willingly, having been
adequately informed about the research. All participants must understand
what they are agreeing to and the risks and benefits of their participation.


Because we are working with children in this study, it is mandatory that we
receive written permission from the PCG or the OCG to interview each
child. In addition to written permission from the primary caregiver,
children must give written permission for their own interview.


Obtaining permission should be the first activity you do upon arriving in
the household. You will only be able to do the Child interview after both
the PCG or OCG and the Child have signed the electronic permission
forms.


You will receive a laminated copy of the permission forms to use if
needed, and paper copies to leave behind for the PCG or OCG. You can
encourage the Respondent to start reading through the laminated copies of
the forms as you prepare the computer for their signature.



**Permission Forms** We have made every effort to simplify the forms so that both parent and
child can read them. However, it is your responsibility to be sure they
understand what they are signing.


1. Give the Respondent time to read the form.
2. If they can’t read it or if they just seem to give it a cursory glance,
you should summarize the key points, which are length of
interview, content of interview, sensitive questions, and token
payment.


The next pages present a detailed summary of each permission form.

**Main Objective** To obtain permission from the PCG or OCG to interview the child.


**Notes and Rules** You **must** obtain permission from the PCG or OCG in order to conduct
the interview with the child. If the PCG/OCG refuses to sign the
permission form, you may interview the PCG and OCG about that child
without interviewing the child. In other words, try to complete the PCG
and OCG interviews. You should use your refusal aversion and
conversion skills as appropriate to attempt to secure permission to
interview the child.


There are different Parent/Guardian Permission Forms for children ages
10-11 (blue) and for children ages 12 years and older (yellow). The
Parent/Guardian Permission Form for children ages 12 years and older
advises parents that the child interview includes questions of a
particularly sensitive nature. SurveyTrak has been programmed to bring
up the age appropriate form. A separate permission form must be signed
for each CDS child in the household.



**If Permission is**

**Denied**



Even if we cannot get a signed parental permission form and, therefore,
cannot interview the child, we will still be able to include the household
in the study. Attempt to conduct the PCG and OCG interviews, and
collect time diary data. Information from the child, however, is a
fundamental part of this study, so it is important to be as persuasive as
possible. Stress to the respondent the importance of the study and
remain positive in your introduction.

the child refuses to sign the Interview Assent Form, attempt to interview
the PCG and OCG about that child without interviewing the child. You
should carefully use your refusal aversion and conversion skills as
appropriate to attempt to secure the child's assent to be interviewed.


There are different Interview Assent Forms for children aged 10-11
years (blue) and adolescents aged 12 and up (yellow). The Interview
Assent Form for respondents 12 and up advises them that the interview
will contain questions of a sensitive nature. To be certain to have the
child sign the Interview Assent Form appropriate for his or her age we
have programmed SurveyTrak to bring up the age appropriate form.
Each CDS child in the household must sign his or her own Assent From.


If the Child/Adolescent doesn’t want to, or can’t read the assent, the
interviewer should read the assent form to them before they sign the
form.

_CHAPTER 4: CHILD INTERVIEW_

Blaise



**Main Objective** To obtain information on cognitive skills of children and adolescent.


**Notes and Rules** The cognitive assessments will be the first piece of the Child Interview. There are
specific instructions for administering the achievement and memory tests.


**We cannot allow any divergence from the protocols for this instrument, nor**
**changes, additions, or deletions in wording of the individual items in the**
**cognitive assessments.**


Since the Child interview begins with us conducting the cognitive assessments,
as interviewers your role is to put the youth at ease. Most youths of this age
group are familiar with taking standardized tests, and we should do our best to
make sure they are not overwhelmed or stressed about these assessments.


40


TOC



**PART B: DETAILS ON THE COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS**



**Introduction to**
**Cognitive**
**Assessments**


**Measurement**

**Tools**


**The Importance**
**of a Quiet**
**Environment**



The Cognitive Assessments in the CDS consist of two components:
(1) three subtests of the WJ-R and (2) the Digit Span subtest from the
Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III).


The WJ-R Test of Achievement is a well-known, established educational
assessment tool. You will administer three subtests. These tests are brief,
and are interesting and enjoyable to children and adolescents alike. They

are:


  - Letter-Word Identification

  - Passage Comprehension

  - Applied Problems


The WISC-III Digit Span subtest tests the respondent’s memory. There are
two parts: one where the respondent repeats what number series the
examiner has said and another where they repeat the numbers backwards to
the examiner.


You will administer the assessments, and enter a correct or incorrect score.
Based on your entries, the computer program will automatically determine
what items should be given at what time. Examiners will be required to
move back and forth in the numerical sequence of the items as part of this
process. This allows the examiner to focus on the respondent, ensuring
they are administering the correct item and entering the correct code for the
respondent’s answer.


The items you will need to administer the measures are:


1. WJ-R easel

2. Your laptop to record responses
3. A blank piece of paper for the respondent to write on during the
Applied Problems subtest of the WJ-R
4. Pencils for the respondent.


It is important when testing youth on standardized assessments to
administer the test in a quiet environment with no other adults or children
present to disrupt the respondent’s concentration. If possible have the child
sit with their back to a wall.


If others must be in the test area, please request that they remain quiet and
provide no coaching.


41


When setting the appointment with the primary caregivers, make sure to
tell them that you will administer a few standardized assessments to the
children/adolescents. Be clear about the need to have a space in the home
that is private. Research has shown that scores on these assessments are
negatively affected by outside interference of noise or people in the testing
environment. Let the primary caregiver know that any interference could
negatively affect the accuracy of the assessment.


**Easel Test** The WJ-R Test is an ‘easel’ test, or a test with a response book that sits in
front of the respondent. Easel tests are administered in the following order:


            - You will ask the respondent a question or give direction.

            - The respondent will review the options on the page.

            - The respondent points to an object or says something.

            - You record their response as correct or incorrect.


**NOTE: Instructions in the WJ-R easel that should be read to the**
**Respondent are in blue.**


**Stay in Control** As with regular interviewing, it is important to control the setting of the
assessment. For the WJ-R, place the easel at an angle so that you and the
respondent can both see the stimuli (pictures) simultaneously. You will
need to see the choice that the respondent has made without much
movement or effort.


Do not let the respondent flip the page forward on the easel test. Stay
upbeat and positive throughout the testing time. Youth will respond to the
atmosphere that you create.


Try to keep the respondents ‘on task’ by repeatedly referring to and
touching the easel test. Use their name from time to time while giving
direction to help personalize the instructions. Use positive and
encouraging statements such as “You’re doing fine” or “Thank you.”



**Avoid Statements**

**that Refer to the**
**Respondent’s**
**Progress**



Always **avoid** statements that refer to the respondent’s progress on the test.
Do **not** use statements like “You got that right,” “No, that is not right,” and
“Are you sure that is the right answer?” Also, be very careful not to give
any facial expression or movement of the head that may indicate that the
respondent has answered an item right or wrong. The respondents will
look at you to check their progress, especially if they are unsure about their
answer. **Avoid** any expression that would give them feedback on their
progress. If they directly ask about their progress, provide a neutral
statement that encourages them to remain engaged such as, “You’re doing
fine.”


42


**Be Aware of the**
**Respondent’s**
**Mood**


**Administer Test**

**Exactly as**
**Written**


**Special**
**Circumstances**



Be aware of the mood of the respondent during testing. Sometimes young
people will just start pointing to pictures without thinking. This usually
happens if a respondent is tired, bored, or frustrated.


Try to gauge whether they are tired, frustrated, or just bored. If this
happens, try to encourage them that the assessment will be over soon. Use
a varied tone of voice and encouraging statements for their efforts. If you
still sense they are responding randomly, try to encourage them to “think
about this before you respond”, or ask if they “need a break?” If they
indicate they would like a break or you feel it is needed, take a short break
(5 minutes) between the sub-tests and let the respondent get up and move
around the testing area, use the bathroom, or get a drink of water. Do not
break during one of the sub-tests, only between them. Do not let them
leave the testing area. They may not come back.


Each test **must be administered** **EXACTLY** as described in training and
in this manual. Any deviation from these procedures will invalidate the
results.


Standardized test administration should be approached with the
understanding that the instructions and wording of the test should not vary
in any way. Words cannot be added, left out, or substituted. The goal of a
standardized test is to measure how well individuals respond to questions
when given identical instructions. An examiner in New York should be
asking the exact same questions as an examiner in San Francisco. When
administered in this manner, the respondents in both of these cities will
have been given the identical test and their scores will be based only on
their ability, and not the testing situation.


The most common mistakes made in using standardized tests, by both
experienced and inexperienced interviewers, is to accidentally point to the
correct answer on the test or to change the wording of the instructions.


There are some exceptions to the restrictions detailed above. Three general
groups that sometimes require small changes in the assessment procedures
are preschoolers, English as a second language (ESL), and individuals with
disabilities.


The CDS children will be ages 10-18, therefore there will not be preschoolers.

**Introduction to**

**WJ-R**



**E** **NGLISH** **A** **S** **A** **S** **ECOND** **L** **ANGUAGE**
If any child or adolescent is having difficulty understanding you, repeat the
instructions. Do not paraphrase or change the wording of the instructions
in an effort to help them comprehend the directions. If you believe they do
not understand English well enough to complete the assessment, please
discontinue the testing. Contact your team leader with any ESL issues; they
will advise you on what to do.


Do not allow a family member to translate for you.


**DISABILITIES**
Always check to see if a respondent should be wearing a hearing aid,
glasses, or other device that helps them to see, hear, or respond to
questions. Most of the measures require pointing. If a respondent is
unable to point, it is acceptable for them to describe their answer to the
interviewer. If a respondent is unable to speak, they can point. Be sure to
make notes about any hearing, visual, cognitive or physical impairment
that may affect the testing situation.


Standardized tests are designed to be administered using strict guidelines
for examiner behavior. One common element of standardized testing is
determining starting and stopping points that allow you to obtain as much
information as you can without administering too many items that are
either too easy or too difficult for the respondent, which can lead to fatigue,
boredom, or frustration.


The term “basal” is used to refer to when the respondent obtains 6 or more
consecutive items correctly. Starting points have been calculated to allow
the majority of respondents to be able to pass the items below it. The term
“ceiling” is used when the respondent answers 6 or more items incorrectly
and a complete page of items has been given. Because the Blaise program
automatically calculates the basal and ceiling using the codes entered by
the examiner, you do not need to determine this. You will never stop in the
middle of a testing page.


Approximately one in three respondents will need to go in reverse order on
the WJ-R, so be attentive to the route the program gives you about what
item to administer.


For the CDS project, we will have clear guidelines on turning the pages.
When you are moving to the next page, either backward or forward, you
will need to pick up the pages by the main tab for that section, find the next
page, and then turn the page over for the respondent to see. This needs to
be done every time you turn the page. Following this guideline, for those
times that you will go backwards, in reverse order, the direction will not be
noticed by the respondent.


44


Also, instructions that should be read to the respondent are printed in blue
on the WJ-R Test Easel. Please be aware of this because it is the opposite
of the Blaise program.


**Starting Points** You want to start testing at the appropriate item number for the
respondent’s grade level. At the beginning of every subtest, usually on the
first page, there is a chart that tells the interviewer at what item they should
start administering the test (see example below).


















|Example:|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|Col8|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Preschool to<br>Kindergarten|Grade<br>1|Grade<br>2|Grade<br>3|Grades<br>4-6|Grades<br>7-9|Grade 10 to<br>Avg. Adult|College &<br>Above Avg.<br>Adult|
|Item<br>1|Item<br>9|Item<br>13|Item<br>20|Item<br>24|Item<br>28|Item<br>32|Item<br>36|



Be sure to look at the chart at the beginning of every subtests as they all
require different starting points depending on the grade level of the
respondent.


To administer the test, the interviewer turns to the page where the starting
item is located. For Passage Comprehension, you will administer a sample
item before beginning the assessment. Make sure you setup the testing area
so that you can view and point on their side of the easel, while you follow
the instructions on your side of the easel and enter in the scored responses.


You will be provided with removable sticky tabs, and can use these to
temporarily mark the starting points for the youth you will be interviewing.
Prior to visiting the household, you will know the age of the respondent.
You can do mark the pages, and then just quickly verify the starting points
when you arrive at the household.


**Scoring** When a respondent gets an item correct, enter a ‘1’ for the item in Blaise.
If the respondent gets an answer wrong, enter a ‘5.’


You need to stay consistent with your hand movements when entering the
answers as the respondent will be watching you for feedback.



**Use of Judgment**
**in Scoring**
**Responses**


**Scoring Multiple**
**Responses**



Occasionally, a subject’s response does not fall clearly into the correct or
incorrect category or it is difficult to decide if the item should be scored as
correct or incorrect on the basis of the key.


In this case, record the actual response as a note in Blaise by hitting F2 to
bring up the comment box. Then score it using your best judgment.


If a person gives more than one answer to an item, score the last answer
given as correct or incorrect. Do not base the score on the earlier response.


45


**Additional Codes**
**in Recording**
**Responses**



Follow this procedure even if a subject changes a response given much
earlier in the testing session. The new response, whether correct or
incorrect, is used as a final basis for scoring that item. For example, when
responding to Item #25 in the Passage Comprehension subtest, a girl
initially responded that her answer was “jar”. Several items later, she
informed the examiner that she was thinking about her earlier answer
“about the whale one” and knew it should be “hamburger”. The examiner
should go back in the program to Item #25 and correctly credit the
response with a “1”. You will only be able to go back to change an answer
when you are within a subtest. Once you end that subtest, you will not be
able to go back, so let the respondent know that you will make a note of
their answer.


If a subject provides both a correct and incorrect response to an item, query
the response by saying something such as, “Which is it?” For example, if a
subject replied that the answer to Item #41 in Applied Problems was “10 or
8 miles”, the examiner should say, “Tell me one answer”.


In addition to using 1’s and 5’s to score, the following can be used when
recording a subject’s responses:


  - Don’t know (control-D): Use this if the subject responds “I don’t
know.”


  - No response or refused (control-R): Use this if the subject does not
respond, or says “I don’t want to answer this.”



**Timing** None of the 4 cognitive assessments have strict time limits for items;
rather, there are guidelines for the amount of time given for each item to
keep the respondent from being too frustrated, bored, or fatigued. Use of
basal and ceiling rules focuses the assessment at the subject’s level of
ability and minimizes testing time.


Please allow the respondent a reasonable amount of time to answer, and
then move on even though he or she might get the answer if given more
time to think. Allow more time for a specific item if the person requests it.
As a guide, each assessment test should take 5-10 minutes to administer.
You can also prompt the respondent, by saying “Do you have an answer?”
If they ask for more time, give them a reasonable amount. If not, you can
say “Now, try this one” and move onto the next item.


During Applied Problems subtests, allow at most approximately double the
typical respondent’s time to compute an answer, and then have (him/her)
move on to the next problem. If the respondent is still working on the
answer using the paper and pencil, let them continue.


46


Take the paper/pencil back from the respondent after the WJ-R assessment
is completed, to help keep the focus on the Digit Span assessment that

comes next.


Remember breaks can be taken between subtests if needed.


**Sample Items** Due to the ages of the CDS-III respondents, you will only administer a
sample item for Passage Comprehension to all respondents regardless of
age. There is a sample item in Letter-Word, but it is will only be
administered on a reversal. According to the grade levels, no one should
start at the sample item for Letter-Word. There are no sample items for
Applied Problems.


When administering a sample item, you need to make sure you mark the
sample time page and the actual starting page for the test. You should
move directly from the sample item to the actual test, without pausing to
find the starting point.

**PART D: DETAILS ON THE CHILD INTERVIEW**


_**Section**_ _**Section Overview**_


**Start of Child Iw** The Child interview begins with the cognitive assessments. You will start
with the Woodcock-Johnson Revised subtests and then continue on with

the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-III digit span memory
subtest. Once these cognitive assessments are complete, you will start the
actual questionnaire portion of the Iw.



**Section E:**
**Reading and**
**Math Skills**


**Section F:**

**Electronic Media**


**Section H: Social**
**Relationships**


**Section J: Social**

**Institutions -**
**Religion, Work,**
**and School**



The Child questionnaire begins with Section E. You will find several
practice questions at the beginning of Section E to help the children and
adolescents understand how to respond to your questions by using a
response set on a scale.


Most of the remaining section focuses on a set of items querying the
respondents about their self-perceived math and reading abilities.


Section F focuses on use of electronic media, including electronic games
and computers. We have a detailed sequence of questions concerning the
purpose and frequency of the youth’s use of the Internet.


Notice that the timeframe for these questions is “in the last month.”


In Section H, we have a series of questions that address peer interactions,
family relationships, and closeness to parents, siblings, and other adults.
We also have a series of questions about the children’s and adolescents’
health. These items (H2) query the respondents about the frequency in
which they experienced a number of physical symptoms. The timeframe
for all questions H1-H4 are “last month.”


Section J is for respondents 12 years of age and older. We begin Section J
with a couple of open-ended questions that query the respondents about
self-identified ethnicity and religiosity.


If a child reports a religion at J2, then we ask four follow-up items:
importance of religion, comfort derived from religion, frequency of
religious service attendance, and frequency of participation in religious
activities. If the respondents do not endorse a specific religion at J2, then
we ask a parallel series of questions about spirituality – whether the
respondents feel spiritual, importance of spirituality in their lives, and
comfort derived from spirituality.


J2a “Interviewer Checkpoint” is designed to direct you through the
religiosity or spirituality follow-up questions. Record “religion

mentioned” at J2a if the respondent reported a specific, established religion
at J2; record “religion not mentioned” at J2a if the respondent said “none,”
“do not believe in god,” “human race,” etc.


At J5, we begin a series of questions about employment. We are interested
in learning, in detail, about children’s and adolescents’ work-for-pay. We
first ask about current full or part-time employment. At J19, we ask the
same series of questions about summer employment. We would like to
know about any work for which the respondent gets paid, but not about
things the respondent does to receive an allowance from his/her family.
We ask about allowances in another section of the interview.


The last set of items in Section J query respondents about school courses
they took during the past two terms, whether the courses were full or halfterm, and the grades received in the courses. These data were designed to
complement the teacher assessments being collected for children in
elementary school.


Children in grades 6-12 will list the name of the class and the grade
received in the class for seven instructional areas (English, math, science,
social science, foreign language, vocational, and “other” – such as art or
drama) for two prior terms. We ask for up to three “mentions” for each
instructional area. Because of the heterogeneity in class choice, names and
grading systems, we will use what you record and carry out detailed postfield coding. For this reason, it is important to probe and record the exact
name of the course.


Sections K and L are self-administered by the respondent, using the
computer. You will use the practice questions to instruct the respondent
on how to use the computer and record responses. You also need to
provide the respondent with the ACASI help card (bright pink) and give
them instructions on the headphones, as wall as an envelope containing
gender-specific Tanner cards.


All of the youth in the sample will get the questions on their stage of
development, and specifically their pubertal stage. These questions will
ask that the respondent review the Tanner Cards and decide which two
figures best represents their current development stage.


In Section K, we ask about respondents’ involvement in school and
community activities, how much time they spend in these activities, and
their friends’ involvement in such activities. The timeframe for these

items is the past 12 months.


Beginning at K8, we ask a series of questions about health, including: selfrated health, self-perceived body weight and things that the respondents do
to maintain, reduce, or increase weight; nutritional intake, exercise, and


54


**Section L (ACASI**

**Years and Up)**



sleep. Note that the timeframe for many of these items is past seven days.
At K18-K19, we ask about limitations in activities due to health or
emotional problem in the past month. Note that at K24, the timeframe
reference shifts to “last 6 months.” The K24 series is about giving support
to family and friends.


Section L is for the youths 12 years old and up. Section L starts out with
series of questions on savings and expenditures. Note that the timeframe
shifts in L4a, L5, and L6. In L4a, the timeframe is last month; L5 is last
three months; and L6 is last 12 months.


At L7, we ask a few questions about dating behaviors, and then at L9, we
ask about school aspirations. At L12, we begin a detailed series about
tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. We want to know if the respondents
regularly use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, the age or onset of use, frequency
of use, and intensity of use.


The remainder of Section L queries the respondents about their
connectedness and autonomy with family and friends, sexual experiences
and pregnancy, and enjoyment of life and social well-being.

**PART E: CHILD ACASI MODULE**


**What is ACASI?** “ACASI” stands for “Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview”.


As questions are presented to the interviewer on the screen, a recording of
the question will be played automatically over a pair of headphones. The
respondents will type the answers into the computer themselves instead of
telling you the response. The respondent will need to listen to the entire
question, before they are able to enter a response.


**Why use ACASI?** The reason we conduct part of the interview using ACASI is to protect the
privacy of the respondent. This particular section includes topics that are
sensitive, and may be uncomfortable to answer.



**Who Does the**

**ACASI Module?**


**Getting Started**
**with ACASI**



Respondents aged 10-11 years old will complete Section K only, while
children aged 12 years and older will complete Section L as well.


There are a few steps to prepare the respondent and the computer to
complete these sections. You may also want to ensure that the youth has
privacy from any other individuals near or in the room.


As mentioned in the cognitive assessment section, it is good practice to
have the youth sit with their back to the wall. This will give them another
level of privacy.


Before you begin the ACASI instructions, be sure to give the Respondent
the correct Tanner Card envelope for their gender. You should hand them
the envelope, and inform them that during this ACASI section they will
receive instructions on what to do with the envelopes. If necessary, inform
the youth that the computer will ask them to pull the contents out, review
them, answer 2-3 questions, then they can place the cards back in the
envelope, and return it to the interviewer.


Then you will read an introduction that explains the ACASI section to the
child. Give the computer to the child and make sure the laptop is arranged
conveniently for the child’s use. It is important to consider the child’s
privacy as well as comfort and convenience when positioning the laptop.
You should not be able to see the computer screen or the keyboard while
the child completes ACASI.


Remember not everyone has used a computer before, so be sure you
explain these directions carefully.


56


**P** **RIMARY** **K** **EYS**


Once the equipment is arranged, you will need to show the child the
location of some of the keys he or she will be using. Make sure the
“ACASI” keyboard card is out and situated in plain view. The respondents
will use this card as a reminder of how to navigate the questions using the
keyboard.

Do not instruct the respondents to back up in the questionnaire.
If they need to back up a question for any reason, have them ask you for
help. When you back up a question, the entire question will be re-played.
You may interrupt the question by pressing the <Ctrl> and <F11> keys at
the same time. Do not show the child this function; it is for your use only.


Instruct the respondent to listen to the entire question.
Instruct the respondent to listen to the entire question and all the responses
before answering.


Set up the audio component.
After you have oriented the child to the computer, attach the headphones to
the computer and show the child how to adjust the volume. Adjust the
headphones so they fit comfortably and the sound is at the appropriate
level.


Take time with the practice items.
The respondent will work through a few practice items before getting
started with Section K. Stay with the respondent while he or she completes
these questions so you can help if necessary.

**Helping the**
**Respondent**


**ACASI**
**Troubleshooting:**
**If the R Cannot**

**Hear the Voice**
**Recording**



Some children or adolescents may need more assistance from you than
others. Such assistance may be as minor as showing the respondent how to
record a dollar amount. Other times, assistance may be more involved,
such as showing the respondent how to delete and re-record a response.


You should give the respondent any help that is requested. Be careful,
however, not to seem intrusive or give more help than requested. Too
much assistance may be perceived as invasive and, consequently, result in
a loss of privacy. Answer any questions and then move away from the
respondent so he or she can complete the rest of the questions in privacy.


Prioritize verbal assistance.

If the respondent asks for help, you should attempt to give verbal
assistance first – without looking at the screen. If verbal assistance is
unsuccessful, then you may need to look at the laptop. Give the child the
option to delete the answer on the screen using the <Backspace> key.


Do not appear to rush the respondent.
This includes body language as well as spoken comments. The ACASI
questions are important and some are sensitive, so the child must be
allowed to take as much time as necessary.


If the respondent cannot hear the voice recording, use these techniques to
troubleshoot the problem:


  - Make sure the instrument is at a screen which is supposed to have
sound. The voice will not start until the screen labeled

INTRO_K0A.


  - Try adjusting the volume. There is volume control on the laptop
_and_ on the headset. Make sure you adjust the volume in both
places.


  - Make sure the headphone jack is in the correct socket – there may
be several similar ones nearby.


  - Make sure the headphone jack is pushed in all the way.


  - If you have tried all of these tips and there is still no sound or if
there are very long delays in moving screen to screen, contact the
Help Desk for assistance.


(NOTE: Respondent may also read the questions if they cannot hear
them.)

_Error messages_
If the child gives an invalid response or enters an invalid range, an error
message will appear and the child is instructed to clear the message by
pressing the <Enter> key and to re-enter the response. Please instruct the
child to ask for your assistance if any other error messages come up. If you
cannot fix the error, call your Team Leader or the Help Desk for assistance.


At the end of the ACASI section, the child will return the computer to you.
At this point, the Child-CAPI interview is almost complete. The final
questions are where you will enter the R’s height and weight.

**General**

**Procedures**



Using the tools provided in your materials, you will measure the
respondent’s height and weight. It is important to obtain accurate
measurements so please take the time to review procedures and practice on
children and adolescents if at all possible.


The measurements you take will be converted into standardized scores so
that we can compare the information from the CDS sample with other
national child and adolescent health studies that set benchmarks for body
mass index for the United States.


You will receive a scale, rafter’s square, tape measure, and post-it notes in
your bulk materials. Take a moment to test the scale and make sure that it
is working properly before you leave training.


There are a few general procedures to follow when conducting the height
and weight measurements. They are:


  - When measuring respondents’ height and weight, do not physically
touch the respondents (e.g., do not help the respondents onto the
scale or take off their shoes). Be certain, however that respondents
safely step on/off the scale.


  - Instruct the child to take off his/her shoes, and step onto the scale,
stand still, etc. A family member may assist you if necessary.


  - Enter the information in Q34A1 and Q34A2.


  - If the respondent refuses to be measured or there are physical
limitations, such as child is in a wheelchair, ask the PCG to give
you the height and weight and the date it was last measured at their
last doctor visit. Follow the Blaise program closely it will guide
you through to enter this information in Q34A3A and Q34A3B.


  - If you aren’t able to take their physical measurements or the
information from their last doctor visit, ask for their best estimate.
This information should be entered in Q34A3C and A34A4C.

There are several specific steps to measuring the respondent’s height:


1. Ask the respondent to take off his/her shoes and to stand against a wall
or door.

2. Place a Post-it note on the wall right above the respondent’s head.
3. Position your rafter’s square against the wall directly over the
respondent’s head.
4. Make a mark on the Post-it note at the respondent’s height.
5. Ask the respondent to move away from the wall.
6. Position the tape measure under a door jam or your foot and measure
from the floor to the mark on the Post-it.

7. Record (his/her) height on the Post-it and then in the Blaise instrument.
8. Be sure to remove the Post-it from the wall.

If necessary, you may also have the primary caregiver measure the
respondent for you and give you the number.


There are several specific steps to measuring the respondent’s weight:


1. In addition to having the respondent remove his/her shoes, ask the
respondent to empty his/her pockets of any heavy items.
2. Clean the scale using an alcohol wipe.
3. Activate the scale and set the scale to zero.

4. Once the scale shows 0.0 have the respondent step on the scale.
5. Have the respondent stand in the center of the scale. The respondent
may need to stand on the center of the scale for 5-10 seconds to assess an
accurate weight.
6. Record (his/her) weight in the Blaise instrument and put away the scale.


Only record information in A3 and A4 if you are unable to actually
measure and weigh the respondent.


If the respondent refuses to be measured, ask the primary caregiver for the
respondent’s height and weight at the last doctor visit. Record the
information at A3a and A4a on page. Record the approximate length of
time since that doctor visit at A3b and A4b.


If the PCG does not remember exact measurements, record “best estimate”
at question items A3c and A4c.

Blaise/self



**Main Objective** To record observed interactions between the primary caregiver and
child/adolescent, and characteristics of the physical environment of the
home and neighborhood. The Interviewer Observations module is used as
one measure of the cognitive stimulation and emotional support parents
provide to children.


**Notes and Rules** This interviewer observation section should be completed as soon as
possible after you leave the household, while the interview is still fresh in
your mind.


You should answer the questions for observations seen during the whole
time you were in the home and not just during the interview itself. If there
are unusual situations, you may want to jot some notes down while you are
still in the household to help you fill out this section completely.


Be as objective as possible. When recording responses to items in this
module, think back on observable events, and try not to be influenced by
your own values or preconceived assumptions. Use the question-byquestion objectives to help you answer as precisely as possible.


There are two sets of Interviewer Observations questions. The first set of
questions is about your observations of the PCG's interactions with each
CDS child. The second set of questions is about the household in general
and should only be completed once for each household.

**Main Objective** To obtain information on the time-use of children during a randomly
selected weekday and weekend day.


**Notes and Rules** Diary days will be assigned by the computer during the Coverscreen
application. The time diary is mailed in advance to the respondent’s home.
The CDS children and adolescents complete the time diary themselves,
with assistance by the primary caregiver as needed.


If diary is not complete at interview time, you will administer the diary.


If the time diary is completed at the time of the household visit, you must
carefully review and edit the diary with the child/adolescent and/or PCG
during the household visit (preferred) or on the phone (optional).


Diary must report on a 24-hour day.


You have been supplied with green pencils to make your edits in the time
diaries.



**Overview of the**

**Instrument**



We obtain information on:


  - Activities during children’s days.

  - Who interacts with children during weekdays and weekend days.

  - How many activities children participate in on a daily basis.

TOC


**PART B: DETAILS ON THE TIME DIARY ADMINISTRATION**


**Introduction** The purpose of the time diary is to obtain the best possible information
about children’s and adolescent’s time use. Time Diaries are an

important and innovative survey tool for gathering such information,
and have been receiving a significant amount of attention in the
research circles that focus on children and adolescents.


**Who is Interviewed?** Respondents find the time diary interesting to do, but reconstructing a
24-hour period is sometimes difficult. For younger children, we have
found that it is often best to interview the children and primary
caregiver together to get the most accurate diary data. The primary
caregiver can help anchor the times by recalling what time the child got
up, ate lunch, etc.


Adolescents, on the other hand, may be better at detailing their daily
activities themselves. Parents may not be aware of all of the details we
ask for each activity recorded in the time diary of a teenager’s life (for
example, the name of the specific TV show that the adolescent
watched, or whom the adolescent was with). You may take the diary
information from them without the primary caregiver’s help if they
clearly recall the day and can place times on their activities.



**Diary Day**
**Assignments**


**Mail Ahead**
**Approach**



There are diary assignments for two days of the week: one weekday
and one weekend day. All children or adolescents in the CDS
household will have the same diary days. Blaise will randomly assign
a diary weekday and weekend day for the children/adolescents in each
household at the end of the Coverscreen.


Because it is difficult to remember our activities in detail for very long,
it is essential that we collect the diary information as close to the diary
day as possible. Using a ‘mail ahead’ diary will help provide us with
accurate information about the child(ren)’s activities on the selected
days, as well as streamline the time you spend with the family.


You will mail the time diaries to the CDS household in advance of your
visit, and request that the respondents complete the diaries about the
two pre-selected days on their own.


Make sure you explain the diaries clearly to the PCG during the
Coverscreen interview, and encourage them to have the
child/adolescent fill them out before the household visit for the

interview.

**Before Mailing the**
**Diaries: Items to**
**Complete on the**
**Cover and Inside the**

**Instructions and**

**Example**


**Reviewing and**
**Probing**



Advance completion of the diaries improves the accuracy of the data
(shortens recall period and makes it easier to remember) and reduces
the amount of time you will be in the household.


Before you send the time diaries to the household, there are several
items on the cover and inside the booklet you must complete.


The first step is to make sure you have a **WEEKDAY** and a
**WEEKEND** diary booklet for each child or adolescent.


Record the child’s/adolescent’s **SID** in the upper left corner. Place one
of your interviewer labels in the upper right corner.


In the lower left corner, record the child’s/adolescent’s first name (first
name only!) and circle the diary day of the week displayed in the
Coverscreen interview. The days selected for the time diary are also
displayed in the SurveyTrak sample line table. The two columns under
the time diary line are called Weekday Diary and Weekend Diary.


The second page of the time diary contains instructions for the
respondents for completing the time diary.


Following the instructions is an example of a time diary for a 16-yearold boy. The example includes descriptions of the boy’s activities and
illustrates how the time dairy should be completed. Please instruct the
respondent to read the instructions carefully before filling out the
diaries.


If the respondents completed the time diary in advance of your
household visit, you will still need to review the diary with them before
you leave the house. This is a necessary and mandatory step that serves
to greatly improve the overall quality of data in the diary. It is
preferred that you complete this step in the home. However, this might
not be possible and we expect that you will need to follow up by phone.


To gather the necessary information, you will need to probe more
extensively than what you would normally do in an interview. You do
not need to record your probes. Please probe any answer that is not
clear to you. If it’s not clear to you, it will likely not be clear to the
coders who will work with the diaries after you mail them to Ann
Arbor.


Probe for detail! Respondents may say at first that they/their child ‘just
sat around all day.’ After probing, however, you will learn that they
probably did other things as well, such as washed and dressed, ate
meals, went to school, talked with friends or family, watched TV or did


66


other things. Be especially attentive to activities that respondents
report taking more than 4 hours (except sleep or going to school or
work). For example, if the respondents report that they/their child was
‘playing’ for 4 hours, probe to find out more about what types of things
the child did. Did he or she watch any TV? Go outside to play? Eat a
snack or meal?


Record activities in the respondents’ own words and probe for detail, so
we know, for example, whether they were reading a book or magazine
(do not record just “reading”), or was playing a board game or a game
of soccer (do not record just “playing a game”). If there are gaps or
overlapping times, probe to get corrected information. If some of the
columns are blank, be sure they get them filled in where appropriate.
Check also for legible handwriting and make sure that the respondent’s
answers meet the objectives of the questionnaire. Make sure every
minute is described. The end time of one activity should be the
beginning time of the next activity. The time you spend carefully
reviewing and editing the diary greatly expands the analytic value of
the instrument. Time use data are one of the most important trends in
research on children and adolescents!


Things to look for when reviewing a time diary with the respondent:

  - The activities are verbs.

  - The activities are what the child/adolescent was doing.

  - Times are correct and add up (read each activity with the
beginning and end time out loud as you review the diary to be
sure it is correct).

  - Probe any long periods of time (any activity lasting over 4
hours except going to school or sleeping).

  - Probe ‘playing’ to find out what the child/adolescent was
playing.

  - Probe ‘reading’ to find out what the child/adolescent was
reading (book, magazine) and whether the child/adolescent was
reading or being read to.

  - Probe if the name of the TV shows, videos, computer games, or
books are not filled in.

  - Probe if secondary activity is not filled in.

  - Check for legible handwriting.

  - Check for travel times between locations and probe to include
these if needed.

  - Make sure that “with whom the child/adolescent is doing the
activity” and “who else is in the same location” columns are
completed.


**Probing is not necessary in Columns H, I and J if the child is**
**sleeping, doing personal care activities, or is at school or at work.**


67


**Editing the Diary** Editing takes place when you have finished interviewing or reviewing
the time diary with the respondent. Use the Editing Checklist (see
Appendix F) and review the completed time diary as follows:


             - Make sure the correct day, date, and child’s/adolescent’s name
are on the front of the face sheet.

             - Make sure all entries are legible.

             - Complete the interviewer box on the front of the questionnaire
that contains mode of interview, date of interview, length of
administration/review, and length of edit.

             - Administration/Review length is the time you spent with the
respondent reviewing or administering the diary.

             - Length of edit is the time you spend on your own cleaning up
and checking the time diary after you have left the respondent’s
home.


**Note on the inside of the face sheet any unusual situations or**
**problems that coders should know about.**


**Double check to be sure the entire 24-hour period is accounted for**
**without gaps or overlaps.**



**After Completing**
**the Diaries with the**

**Respondents**



Record **mode of interview** :


Mode of interview refers to how the time diary was completed.
Response codes are: (1) SAQ; (2) FtF; (3) Phone. Circle all that apply.
For example, if the respondents recorded information on their own, and
you edited the diaries in person while at the home, you would circle:
“(1) SAQ” and “(2) FtF.” If the respondent did not complete any of the
diaries on her own and you administered the time diaries while at the
home, you would circle: “(2) FtF.”


Record **respondent** :


Respondent refers to the individual who provided the information for
the time diary – whether he or she completed it alone or with you. The
response codes are: (1) Child/Adolescent; (2) PCG (3) OCG (4) Other.
Circle all that apply. For example, if the OCG and the child did the
diary together, then circle both: “(1) Child/Adolescent” and “(3) OCG.”
If you worked with just the adolescent on the diary then circle: “(1)
Child/Adolescent.”


In the bottom right corner is a box with “Date of TD Iwer
Administration/Review,” “Length of TD Iwer Admin/Review,” and
“Length of TD Iwer At-Home Edit.”


68


**Standards for**

**Diaries**



Information recorded for these three items are:


**Date of TD Iwer Administration/Review** is the date on which the
interviewer talked with the respondent to administer or edit the
interview.


**Length of TD Iwer Admin/Review** should be calculated and
recorded. The interview length is the amount of time the
interviewer spent talking with the respondent, either collecting or
reviewing the child’s time diary information.


**Length of TD Iwer At-Home Edit** is the amount of time the Iwer
spends going over the diary after it is completed to get it ready to
send to Ann Arbor.


Two things to keep in mind when editing and administering time
diaries are:


1. Every minute of a 24-hour time period must be accounted for
2. There is never too much detail – the researchers code these data

in very fine level detail, so the more information you and the
respondent provide, the more accurate the data coding.


A key objective of the time diary method is to account for every minute
in a given time frame. The time diary for CDS encompasses a 24-hour
period, beginning at midnight and ending at midnight. You and the
respondent must have activities and details about such activities
recorded for every minute in the entire 24-hour period of the selected
time diary day.


We cannot stress enough the importance of complete data. It is
extremely important that the respondent does not leave any gaps of
time in accounting for the 24-hour period. All analyses assume that
each child/adolescent has 1440 minutes to spend on each selected day.
If the respondent doesn’t want to indicate or can’t remember the
specific activity and requested details for a certain period of time, you
must note this in the diary. **Include as much detail about the activity**
**as possible.**


In addition to the activity itself, we need to know where the activity
took place and whether other people were involved in the activity. See
the probing instructions for details on different types of locations and
key points to keep in mind when reviewing. We need as accurate
information as possible about who is interacting with the child and who
else is in the same place but not directly interacting with the child. The
next section provides more details about recording and probing
activities.


69


We are also trying to get a better understanding of secondary activities.
The question ‘Was the child doing anything else at the same time?’ is
extremely useful in picking up activities that might not normally be
reported. If it was left blank, you need to probe for any secondary
activities.


Look over the sample time diary that is included in the first pages of
the time diary booklet to get an idea of the amount of detail we would
like. If, in cases where you interview two siblings, you find a
discrepancy between the diaries, do not revise either one in an attempt
to make them identical.


**Editing Time Diaries** As outlined above, before you leave the household (if time permits), you
will review the time diaries and make edits as necessary. As soon as
possible after the household visit, review the materials from the
household. When the time diaries are finalized, place them along with a
transmittal form into an envelope and send them immediately to Ann
Arbor. Notify your Team Leader that you have completed a household.


Take adequate time to review the time diaries and make sure that the
recorded information will make sense to the coder. If you realize that
you have missed something or there is a conflict, **CALL THE**
**RESPONDENT BACK IMMEDIATELY** . It is better to call back
immediately, while the interview is still fresh in the respondent's mind.


There are some general tips that you can keep in mind while editing.


Please check that:


             - All entries are **legible** .

             - All remarks are indicated in parentheses and recorded where
they occurred.

             - All ambiguities or inconsistencies in the respondent's answers
are marked with a marginal note.


Be sure that you have attached your interviewer label and recorded the
SID accurately on each diary before mailing it to Ann Arbor.



**Send Time Diaries to**

**Ann Arbor**



When you have completed all components of a household interview,
you will need to send the Time Diaries (2 per child) to Ann Arbor.


In order to ensure that no items are lost in mailing, the Time Diaries
should be sent to Ann Arbor via UPS. The tracking number for each
package should be recorded in SurveyTrak on the Control tab in the
View/Edit screen.

SECTION IV: INTERVIEWING YOUTH


**PART A: PREPARING FOR THE INTERVIEW**

**Be Neutral, Don’t**
**Judge Others’**
**Way of Life or**
**Parenting Style**


**Tell Primary**
**Caregiver What**
**You Will be**
**Doing**



Interviewing in households with youth poses a special challenge for
Interviewers, particularly when the Interviewer needs to talk with the youth
one at a time in a quiet setting away from the rest of the household. While
there is no guaranteed way to make every interview go completely
smoothly, there are several tricks you can use to increase the chances that
this will be a fun and pleasurable experience for you, the respondent, and
the rest of the household. Your approach should be similar to a good
teacher: friendly manner, yet maintain control over the situation.


It is important to take into account the age of the youth you are
interviewing and adjust your behavior and interaction accordingly.
Although all youth develop at different rates, age is a good guideline for
maturity level.


For the CDS-III, all of the respondents we interview will be at least 10
years old, and most, if not all, are in school. About half of them will be 12
years of age and older.


As with all interviews, it is important to leave your judgments at the door
when you enter a household. Sometimes this is more difficult to do when
children are involved since many people have very definite and strong
views about the right and wrong way to raise a child. It is important to be
accepting of everything in the household, even if it is not what you would
do with your own children.


Let the primary caregiver know what you will be doing and what you will
need at the time when you make the appointment.


This is probably the most important and useful thing you can do - tell the
primary caregiver that you will need to interview each youth one at a time
in a quiet place away from any distractions and other people in the
household. Enlist the primary caregiver’s support in finding a suitable
place to do the interview and assessments, and in setting up the interview
times so that each child or adolescent is at his or her best during the
interview.


Spend a little time talking with the primary caregiver and let her know
what the different portions of the interview are all about. Parents often
believe their child to be above average in skills, so it is important to listen


73


**Ask About**

**Household**

**Routine**


**Schedule the**

**Interview at the**

**Best Time**


**The Interview**
**Setting**



and respect this perspective. Depending on the age of the child, parents
assume that they can be present when the testing is occurring. It is
important to handle the need for seeing the child or adolescent privately in
a diplomatic manner.


Also, note that the PCG or OCG must be present to sign the permission
form prior to conducting the interview with the CDS child, but they do not
have to be present for the entire interview. However, you cannot be alone
in the house with a child, so an adult 18 years of older (such as a
grandparent) must be in the household during the entire time you are
conducting the interview.


Because it is important that each child is interviewed, be sure to ask
specifically about activities the youth may have (sports practice or games,
lessons, etc.) when you make the interview.


TV and radio is a distraction to most people, but for some families it is on
all the time and used for background noise. If that is the case, it may be
best not to ask to have the TV turned off since the quiet may be more
distracting to the child than the ‘normal’ TV sounds. If the TV is on and
the child is trying to watch it while doing the test, ask to have the TV
turned off.


Ask the primary caregiver about the household schedule and suggest times
for an interview so that everyone will be home and at their best. People
tend to be less attentive and less patient when they are hungry or tired, so
try to avoid interviewing right before meals. Adolescents, in general are
not likely to be as awake in the early morning hours, so schedule midmorning or afternoon times are likely to be optimal. Most school-aged kids
have very busy schedules and numerous lessons, activities, clubs, etc. after
school, so be aware that you will have to plan the interview around these
schedules. Enlist the primary caregiver's help in determining the best time
to interview each child.


Although you need a quiet place to interview the child or adolescent, do
not go into a room alone with a child and close the door. Leave the door
open and tell the primary caregiver that it is all right to ‘look in’ at any
time. If, for any reason, the primary caregiver insists on being present, that
is acceptable. The primary caregiver must stand or sit behind the child, out
of his or her view. The primary caregiver may not make any gestures or
noises. Explain to the primary caregiver that any reactions from her will
distract the child and negatively affect the interview's accuracy.


Also, do not use the youth’s bedrooms. Their rooms will be filled with
toys and belongings, and this may cause distraction. Other places in the
home may be equally distracting, especially for older children and

**Other Children**

**Present**



adolescents. Avoid places with televisions, computers, cell phones, etc.,
and use your best judgment about the most appropriate place to conduct the
interview.


There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting a place to interview.


  - Try to eliminate distracting items (e.g., toys, games) from the area.

  - Arrange the table and chairs so that the child’s attention will be
focused on you and the materials. Because the door to the room
you are interviewing the child in will always remain open, you
should try not to have the child face the doorway. Try to seat the
child catty-corner from you.

  - Have all your materials arranged so the interview runs smoothly.
Children can become easily distracted if you have to keep looking
for your materials.


You may want to engage the other non-participating children in an activity
while you are interviewing another child or adolescent. The primary
caregiver can be a great help to you in keeping other children occupied, but
if necessary, you may want to give younger children paper and pencil to
draw to keep them occupied. You may have to be fairly direct with
inquisitive children who are not being interviewed and ask them to go in
the other room until you are finished. If they are going to be interviewed
later, assure them that they will get their turn soon. Enlist the primary
caregiver’s help if the situation becomes difficult.

**Introduction**
**to the Study**



Do not touch the child for any reason at any time while you are in the
household. If necessary, enlist the primary caregiver’s help when measuring
the child's height and weight, or for repositioning the child for a better view of
the Woodcock-Johnson assessment easel.


It is important for the children to feel at ease with the Interviewer and the
interview setting before starting. Some youth will warm up to you very
quickly. Others will take a few minutes of chatting before they settle down.


Always greet the youths by smiling, saying hello, and introducing yourself.
Ask them questions about activities, hobbies, pets, toys, school, or favorite
games or TV shows to get them talking about things with which they are
familiar.


When speaking to a child or an adolescent, maintain eye contact as you would
if speaking to an adult.


It’s a good idea to ask the youth if he or she needs to use the bathroom or
needs something to eat or drink before you start the interview. Any breaks
taken before the interview begins will make the process go more smoothly.


Say a few introductory sentences about the types of questions you will ask of
the child. Make sure the child or adolescent knows that there are no right or
wrong answers to any of the questions. We just want to know his or her
thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Also explain to the child that his/her answers are
confidential, which means that no one else will see his/her answers.



**Pace Yourself** You will be in the household for a long time, and interviewing children is one
of the most tiring and demanding types of interviewing there is. To keep
yourself from getting too fatigued, take a small break between interviews.
Stay upbeat and positive throughout the testing time. Children and adolescents
will respond to the atmosphere that you create.



**Keep the**
**Child/**

**Adolescent on**

**Task**



Children, especially young children, can be difficult to test and control. Here
is a list of things you can do to help keep the respondent on task:


  - Use positive and encouraging words. Respond to the child equally for
right and wrong answers, using neutral but friendly feedback, such as
“Thank You.” You may use general statements of praise, such as
“You’re doing fine” as needed, but don’t over do the praise so much


76


**Things to**
**Avoid**


**Things to be**
**Aware of**



that it appears insincere. Try not to encourage the child during the
middle of a set of questions. Some children may take a statement, such
as ‘good job,’ to mean that they got the question correct. As a result,
children may change their remaining answers due to your
encouragement. If you feel you need to say something during the
middle of a set of questions, only say neutral phrases like “That’s fine.”
Between sections of the questionnaire, use positive and encouraging
words tailored to the child or adolescent's age such as:


`o` “Good job”
`o` “You’re doing a lot of thinking”
`o` “You are really listening”
`o` “I like the way you are listening”


  - Some children will also get bored with the task. Try to gauge whether
they are tired or just bored. If they seem bored, try to encourage them
that the test or section will be over soon. If they are tired, take a break
after a section.


Always **avoid** statements that refer to the child’s progress on the test. Do **not**
use statements like “You got that right,” “No, that is not right,” or “Are you
sure?”


Also, be very careful not to give any facial expression or movement of the
head that may indicate that the child has gotten an item right or wrong. The
child will always look at you to check their progress especially if they are
unsure about their answer. **Avoid** any expression that would give them
feedback on their progress.


Be aware of your facial expressions and other nonverbal language. Children
are very receptive to nonverbal cues. Try to convey a positive, comfortable
message in general. Make sure your nonverbal language is not tied to
questions or the child’s responses.


Be aware of the mood of the child during testing. Some younger children will
get very tired and just start pointing to pictures. If the child seems to be
getting tired, suggest taking a short break (5 minutes) between the tests and let
the child get up and move around the testing area or get a drink of water. Do
not break during one of the sections, only between them. Try not to let the
child leave the space where the test is, they may not come back.

**Tips for**
**Interviewing**
**Adolescents**


**Communication**
**Strategies for**
**Adolescents**



**PART C: WORKING WITH ADOLESCENTS**


Working with adolescents can present special challenges above what you
can normally expect when working with younger children. Adolescents are
somewhere between being children and adults. Each adolescent is at a
different stage of development, regardless of his or her chronological age,
and each may act more or less mature depending on the particular
circumstances of your interaction. You may find that some adolescents are
much easier to interview than young children while others present more
resistance than their younger siblings.


In this study, interviews with adolescents may take considerably longer than
interviews with younger children. Therefore, it is especially important for
you to gain the adolescent's cooperation and trust in order to make the
interview go smoothly and as quickly as possible. It is helpful to keep a
few things in mind to ease your interviews with adolescents.


1. Address the adolescent directly as if you were speaking to an adult.
As you get to know him or her, take into account the adolescent's
development level and adjust your interaction accordingly.


2. Respect his or her privacy and confidentiality, as you would with all
respondents, especially during the ACASI portions of the interview.
Explain confidentiality and consent clearly.


3. Withhold judgment. Remember that adolescents may "try on"
different personal styles which adults might find unusual or
offensive and that this is a natural part of development.


4. Be honest and straightforward with the adolescent during the
interview.


5. Give the adolescent control over some portion of the interaction.
You may need to negotiate with him or her as you would with an
adult rather than simply directing behavior as you would with a
child.


6. Remember that all adolescents are different. Some reluctant

teenagers may open up right away and a few may never trust you.

TOC


**PART D: SPECIAL SITUATIONS WITH CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS**



**If the Primary**
**Caregiver Asks to**
**See the Results of**

**the Assessments**



Primary caregivers often ask how their child 'did on the test.' The
assessments will not be scored until they are returned to the central office,
so you will have to tell the PCG that you do not have the results. Let them
know that we will not have individual data available, but we will send the
results of our study as a whole when our final data are available (in 1-2
years).



**Shy** If a young child is very shy (hiding behind the primary caregiver and
obviously uncomfortable with strangers), you may need to interview the
child while he or she is sitting with the primary caregiver. This is
acceptable, but you will need to ask the primary caregiver not to coach the
child in any way or try to help with the interview.


**Unresponsive** If the child does not respond to a question, wait 10 seconds and then repeat
the question. If the child still doesn’t respond or says ‘I don’t know,” ask
the child to make his/her best guess. You can say, “It’s all right to guess,”
or "I only want to know how YOU think or feel." You can also let the
child know that you understand the questions are difficult.


**Distracted** You should have freed the interviewing area of distracting items and made
it so the child’s back faces the door. Hopefully, this will cut down on the
amount of time a child is distracted, but we cannot always interview
children in the ideal environments and some children are easily distracted.
If you find yourself trying to interview a ‘distracted’ child, here are some
things to try:


            - Use positive and encouraging words.

            - Repeatedly refer to and touch the child’s response booklet.

            - Make sure items on the table, except the child’s response book, are
out of reach of the child.

            - Politely remove any distracting toys or objects from the child and
put them out of the child’s sight.

            - Take a break.

            - If these fail, you could try interviewing the child later during your
visit.


**Tired/Frustrated** Try taking a break (stretch, drink of water). If a break doesn’t help, try
interviewing the child at a slightly faster pace. Some children may appear
tired when they are bored with the pace of the interview.


79


**Overactive/Hyper** If the child is squirming or moving around, let the child know that he or
she needs to be seated with feet still to do the interview. If he or she talks

off the topic, then politely guide him or her back to the interview.


**‘Response Set’** Some children give the same answer for every question or the same pattern
of answers for several questions, such as 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, etc. If this
happens, you can try encouraging the child with positive statements or try
taking a break. If the child answers you before you finish a question say,
“(Name), I want you to listen to me read the question, then you will have
your turn to answer.”



**English as a**
**Second Language**



Before conducting the interview, determine if the child speaks and
understands English well. If they do not understand English at all, then
they cannot be tested with the English language assessments or interview.



**Disabilities** Always check to see if a child should be wearing a hearing aid, glasses, or
other device that helps them to see, hear, or respond to questions. Most of
the assessment measures require pointing. If a child is unable to point, it is
acceptable for them to describe their answer to the Interviewer. If a child
is unable to speak, they can point. Any hearing, visual, or physical
impairment that may affect the testing situation should be noted in the
Interviewer notes.



**Suspected Child**
**Abuse**



If you see what you believe to be child abuse, report it to your Team
Leader. If, for any reason, you do not feel comfortable with that, you can
contact the Study Management Staff
The study has a system in place to take appropriate
action. You should not threaten the parents with being reported or do
anything in the interview situation that would lead the parent to believe
that their confidentiality is being threatened. Remember that we have
signed a confidentiality pledge that protects the information that they give

us.


**If a situation escalates to physical violence while you are in the house,**
**excuse yourself and leave the home.** Call your TL or PC right away. Do
not put yourself at risk at anytime during the interview. You should also
**not** comment to the primary caregiver about any action (slapping in the
face, hitting, etc.) that occurs in your presence. If you have any questions
or concerns regarding an interview, please call your Team Leader or the
Study Management Staff, and we will do our best to resolve the situation.

SECTION V: ADMINISTERING THE OVERALL PROCESS


**PART A: SPECIAL CDS INTERVIEWING PROTOCOLS**



**Sequence of**
**the**

**Instruments**



Although there is a recommended order in which the various portions of each
household case can be completed, the Interviewer and the CDS family have a
great deal of flexibility to determine the most convenient way to complete all
of the tasks. As the Interviewer, you should consider the unique characteristics
of each CDS family when planning contacts, appointments, and administration
of each part of the interview. There are several guidelines that must be
followed when setting the order for the interview:


  - At least one of the CDS children must be located before beginning the
Coverscreen.

  - The Coverscreen **must** be completed first, usually over the phone.

  - The Parent Permission Forms and Child Interview Assent Forms **must**
be signed in person before the child is interviewed.


Adhere carefully to all rules outlined in this manual concerning mode of
administration for all portions of the interview. Be certain to take these rules
into account when planning how you will complete each household. For
example, the child interview **must** be completed in person; the PCG and OCG
interviews may be completed over the telephone if that is more convenient.


While all parts of each case are important, the most crucial are the
Coverscreen, the PCG, and Child interviews. Therefore, you should place a
priority on completing these interviews in Blaise. Even if the time diaries or
OCG interviews are not completed, the information from the PCG Blaise and
Child interviews will still be useful to Study Staff.


Beyond those guidelines, it is up to the Interviewer and the CDS family to
decide the most convenient way to complete all portions of each case.


Because there are several instruments to be administered in each household, we
expect that each household may take between 3.5 hours and 5 hours to
complete. It is likely that for some households you will need more than one
household visit to complete all portions of each case.


If you have any questions about how best to complete a case with a specific
CDS family, consult your Team Leader to discuss the situation and possible
solutions.


81


**Team**
**Interviewing**



In order to reduce the household burden and to avoid break-offs and

rescheduling, under certain circumstances interviewing teams may be created
to complete households with more than one targeted child. Team Leaders will
be responsible for creating teams where needed and coordinating their work.


Guidelines for team interviewing are as follows:


  - In areas where sample density supports two or more CDS Interviewers,
team interviewing may be planned for households containing two CDS
children.


  - Team Leaders will review sample assignments and, if needed, create
interviewing teams of two Interviewers per team. Team Leader will
notify interviewers as to which cases are to be attempted using a team
approach.


  - The Interviewer to whom the case is assigned in SurveyTrak will be the
lead Interviewer for that case. The lead Interviewer is responsible for
making initial contact with the household, completing the Coverscreen
and coordinating appointment schedules with the second Interviewer, as

necessary


  - Once in the household, interviewing tasks will be divided between the
two Interviewers in whatever manner allows for the most efficient use of

time.


  - For cases that will be completed by a team, as with all cases, try to
complete the PCG Blaise interviews over the telephone to minimize the
amount of time that must be spent in the household.


  - If the team cannot complete everything for a case in one household visit,
think carefully and consult with your Team Leader about how best to
finish the case. It is probably not necessary for both members of the
team to return to the household for a second visit. If at all possible, the
lead Interviewer should make every effort to complete the case alone.


  - If the household composition has changed, and the case turns out to have
only one CDS child, the interview will be done by a single Interviewer
instead of by the team.


  - If scheduling conflicts make it impossible for both Interviewers to be at
the home when the respondent is available to do the interview, the
interview should be done by a single Interviewer.


  - All decisions regarding team interview must be reviewed with your
Team Leader.

**Spanish**
**Language**
**Interviews**



There may be some CDS families in which Spanish is the primary and
preferred language spoken at home. We have identified the families that are
potential cases for Spanish language interviewing based on the language in
which the 2007 PSID interview was done. These cases will be assigned to
bilingual Interviewers. If you are not a bilingual Interviewer and have any
respondents for whom the use of the Spanish language would provide a more
accurate interview, contact your Team Leader so that arrangements can be
made to conduct those interviews in Spanish.


Since the CDS children are now 10 years of age and older, and based on past
wave information, we expect that most of them will be fluent in English and
will be able to complete the entire interview in English. Therefore, the CDS
Child interview has not been translated into Spanish. In the event that a child
does not speak enough English to complete the interview, contact your Team
Leader immediately.


It is more likely that the PCG or OCG will prefer to conduct the interview in
Spanish. We will conduct only the Coverscreen and the PCG interviews in
Spanish, and will have permission forms and letters in Spanish as well. The
OCG is not translated and the OCG interview will not be completed for
Spanish cases.


Language preference for each household based on the 2007 PSID interview
language will appear on the SurveyTrak main screen (1=English, 2=Spanish,
7=Other).


If you have a case with Spanish language preference indicated in SurveyTrak,
follow these steps:


  - Contact the household and determine if the PCG requires a Spanish
language interview.

  - If you are a bilingual Interviewer, make sure you have the introductory
letter in Spanish. If you need help obtaining these items, contact your
Team Leader. Also be sure you are able to access the electronic Spanish
permission forms before going to the household to complete the Child
interview.

  - Make the appointment for the household visit and introduce the study to
the parents in Spanish with those respondents who require it and in
English with those respondents who prefer that. The child Blaise
interview must be conducted in English. If the child is unable to
complete the Blaise interview in English, do not do this portion of the
interview.

  - If you are not a bilingual Interviewer, contact your Team Leader so that
the case can be assigned to a bilingual Interviewer.


The Blaise hot key CTRL-L allows the interviewer to switch between English
and Spanish if needed.

**Respondent**
**Incentives**


**Interviewer**

**Observations**



Incentives will be paid by check for most respondents. Payment will be
generated automatically through the Respondent Pay system in SurveyTrak. If,
for any reason, the Interviewer needs to pay the respondent in cash, there will
be a place in SurveyTrak for the Interviewer to record payment. There will also
be an electronic receipt for the respondent to sign when you pay in cash.


**PCG Incentives**
The primary caregiver will receive a check for $75 once the PCG interview
with the priority flag is complete.


**OCG Incentives**
The other primary caregiver will receive a check for $20 once the OCG
interview with the priority flag is complete.


**Child Incentives**
Each child will receive a check for $40 once the interview and assessments are
completed. The Time Diaries do not have to be completed in order for the
Child to be paid.


After you conclude the household visit, you must complete the Interviewer
Observations. This should be done as soon as possible after you have left the
household while the visit is still fresh in your mind. Do not complete the
Interviewer Observations in the presence of any of the respondents.


The Interviewer Observations questions are from the HOME Scale, a widely
used instrument that assesses social and environmental influences on children's

and adolescents' development. These measures are based on your observations
as an Interviewer in the home. These questions are an integral part of the
information we gather from the household, so we ask that you please give each
item careful thought.


There are two sets of Interviewer Observations questions:


1. The first set of questions is about your observations of the PCG's
interactions with each CDS child.

2. The second set of questions is about the household in general and
should only be completed once for each household.


Interviewer Observations are triggered only after the Child interview is
complete. If the PCG is not present during the Child Interview, then you have
not had the opportunity to observe the PCG –Child/Adolescent interactions,
therefore answer “did not observe” in for those questions in the interviewer
observations.

**PART B: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**


**General Review** A short overview of the Interviewer's tasks for this project was presented in
_Section 1: Introduction to the Study_ . In the following pages, you will be
provided with a detailed description of these tasks and the procedures for
administering them.



**Before the**
**Study Begins**


**Receive and**

**Review**

**Materials From**

**Ann Arbor**



The Study Specific Training will help you learn the basic procedures for
this study. Be sure you have thoroughly reviewed this manual and other
study materials and understand the concepts and procedures required of the
project.


In addition, you should review your General Interviewer Training Concepts
manual before coming to in-class training. During training you will be
expected to display knowledge of these concepts. If you are unsure about
any procedures or concepts, be sure to review them or confirm them with
your Team Leader **before** you begin interviewing. You will be evaluated on
your implementation of these concepts during the data collection period.


Your bulk study materials will be shipped to you immediately after training.
When you receive them, organize your materials and verify that you have
everything you will need to complete your interviews successfully.


Because the field period is not long (October through February), it is crucial
and expected that you begin your assignment as soon after training as
possible. A quick start to production interviewing will help solidify the
concepts and procedures you learned during training.


You will receive your Interviewer materials and enough supplies for each of
your cases in a separate package sent from Ann Arbor. Please see the Bulk
Materials list in _Section VI: Field Notes_ for a full list of supplies in this
package.


The package will also include the paper CDS materials needed for an
interview:


  - Extra paper copies of Permission forms. You may leave a copy of
these forms with the PCG or OCG, if requested.

  - Child Respondent Booklets (used with the Child questionnaire).

  - Weekday Time Diaries (one for each targeted child).

  - Weekend Time Diaries (one for each targeted child).

  - PCG Respondent Booklets (used with the PCG questionnaire).

  - OCG Respondent Booklets (used with the OCG questionnaire).


85


**Pre-Contact**

**Letters**


**Contact the**

**Household**



When you receive these materials, review them thoroughly to make sure
you have everything on the enclosed packing list. If items are missing, you
can send an e-mail request to the Field Interviewer Supplies email group at
Please see _Section VI: Field Notes_ for more details
about requesting supplies.


Before you are ready to begin work on a case, send a pre-contact letter to
the household about 1 week before you contact the household to schedule
the interview. These letters will be provided for you in your bulk materials.
The letter will remind respondents that their family has participated in CDS
in 1997 or 2002 and ask for their participation again. The letters will also
let respondents know that an Interviewer will be calling them to make an
appointment for a household visit to conduct the interview with the primary
caregiver and the CDS children. The pre-contact letter will hopefully
smooth the way for your initial telephone contact with the household. See
Appendix A for a copy of the letter.


It is a good idea to allow a week for the letter to reach the respondent. It
may take longer than that for the letter to be returned by the post office, but
you should start calling after about a week.


Send pre-contact letters in the #10 franked envelopes you will receive in
your bulk materials. These envelopes have the University of Michigan
return address. Also be sure to fill in your interviewer identification number
and write “CDS” on the envelope. You should also write on the
envelope so that it is returned to the Production Manager. This information
is critical to enable Study Staff to contact you in case your pre-contact letter
is returned to Ann Arbor.


During your first call to the household:


  - Identify yourself and the study before you get into the Coverscreen.


  - Determine that one (or both) CDS children reside in the HH.


  - Determine the identity of the PCG – whenever possible, that is the
person who should complete the Coverscreen.


  - Complete the Coverscreen carefully.


  - Describe the household interview session including the child
interview and assessments. Discuss the need for a quiet place to
conduct the interview.


  - Let the primary caregiver know the expected length of the visit. If a
household has only 1 target child then the household interview
length (including the Time Diaries) is between 3 and 3.5 hours; if a
household has 2 target children then the household interview length

will be doubled, unless you do team interviewing.


  - Set an appointment for the Face-to-Face interviewing session
ensuring that all the targeted respondents will be available. Make
sure the PCG or OCG will be home to sign the consent and that an
adult (18 years or older) will be home during this session.


  - Balance what must be done during the household visit with those
parts that may be completed over the telephone. When scheduling
an appointment for a household, try to set an appointment to
interview both the PCG and OCG over the telephone. If you are
going to interview the PCG or OCG over the phone, be sure to send
the PCG and OCG Respondent Booklets ahead of time along with
the time diaries.


  - Explain time diaries. It is very important that you fully explain the
time diary over the phone to the primary caregiver. It will save you
a lot of time and hassle if the time diaries are correctly completed
for the selected days when you arrive at the household.


  - Explain the OCG interview. If you aren’t able to set the interview
appointment for the OCG; try to find a good time to call back.


  - Verify the address and indicate that you will send a packet in the
mail. Send the packet with the memo, respondent booklets, and time
diaries as soon as possible after the call.


One of the most valuable tools available to you in contacting and tracking
respondents is the Respondent Profile. The Profile for CDS will be
available in SurveyTrak and will contain information from the 2007 PSID
interview including the date of interview; CDS children in the household,
their ages, and their relationships to the head of household; other household
members, their ages, and their relationships to the head of household; and
perhaps most importantly, information from the 2007 PSID interview
Interviewer Observations. You should review the Profile for each case

before contacting the household so that you are well prepared for the
circumstances and respondents you will find there.


Step 1:
Prepare the interview packet and send it to the respondent prior to your
interview, as soon as possible after you complete the Coverscreen and make
the interview appointments.


Each household packet should contain:


  - A Household Introduction Letter addressed to the PCG with your
name, the OCS’s name, and the selected child(ren)'s name(s) and
interview time filled out


87


**Visit the**

**Household**




  - Two child time diaries (one weekday and one weekend day) per

child with the child's first name and selected dates filled in.


  - Include respondent booklets for the PCG or OCG, if you will be
completing these interviews over the telephone. Make sure they get
the booklets before the telephone interviews (though you can do the
interview without them).


Step 2.
Prepare your materials for the face-to-face interview and put them in a the
plastic file envelope that holds all materials for one household:

  - Respondent booklet for the child instrument

  - If you are doing the PCG and/or OCG interviews at the same time,
respondent booklets for the PCG and OCG

  - Extra copies of blank time diaries and green pencils

  - Extra copies of the permission forms.


When you visit the household for the interviews, you will take your bag
with the following items in addition to the Interviewer materials described
above:


  - Plastic envelope with paper materials listed above for this case

  - Laptop computer with case and headset for ACASI

  - Tanner Card Envelopes

  - ACASI help card

  - WJ-R easel

  - Tape measure

  - L-bracket to measure height

  - Weight scale

  - 2-3 #2 pencils

  - Blank paper

  - Post it notes

  - Extra advance letters

  - Alcohol wipes

**Certification**
**Requirements**



SECTION VI: FIELD NOTES


**PART A: PREPARATION FOR INTERVIEWING**


The CDS Team is made up of a large number of people working together in
different roles to make the study a success. We have designed your training
to make sure that you are knowledgeable, confident, and well prepared as an
Interviewer to collect high quality data. We are committed to supporting you
in this task during the field period and are always available to provide help.


Your responsibilities include active participation in training, meeting the
Interviewer production expectations, and asking for support when you need it
from your Team Leader, Production Coordinator, Production Manager, or
Study Director.


During training and prior to the start of production interviewing, all
Interviewers are required to pass a series of certifications. This provides
confirmation that you have learned the necessary skills for interviewing.
Below are the certification requirements for all CDS Interviewers:


**Certification on Coverscreen – Day 3**
Interviewers will complete a one-on-one certification on the Coverscreen.
Completing the Coverscreen accurately is key to the success for collecting all
of the data for each household. One-on-one practice opportunities, as well as
re-certification opportunities will be available.


**Primary Caregiver (PCG) instrument – Day 3**
Interviewers will complete a Round-Robin type certification at their tables.
One-on-one opportunities for more practice, as well as for re-certification on
these instruments, will be provided.


**Certification on Cognitive Assessments – Day 4**
Because the cognitive assessments (WJ-R and WISC digit span) are a part of
the Child instrument, it is important that practice flows along with the
instrument itself. Five hours of practice in the full Child instrument will be
provided before certification. You will also have a stand-alone system
loaded on your tablet to practice on your own. Certification on the Child
interview, from the consent process through the cognitive assessments will be
completed one-on-one in a “Rotation Station Certification” (RSC) setting.
Interviewers will be assigned a time to come for certification. They will be
required to set up their computer and easel before beginning. A respondent
and a certifier will be set up at each station, as well as observers. One-on-one
opportunities for more practice, as well as for re-certification on these
instruments, will be provided.

**Certification on full Child instrument and Physical Measures – Day 4**
Immediately following the RSC certification, interviewers will certify on the
remaining Child instrument in a Round Robin setting. This will include the
ACASI portion of the interview, and all interviewers will be required to
certify individually on setting up for ACASI and presenting the Tanner
Cards. Certification on the physical assessments will be done individually.
One-on-one opportunities for more practice, as well as for re-certification on
these instruments, will be provided.


**Certification on Other Caregiver (OCG) instrument – Day 5**
Certification on the OCG will be completed in a Round-Robin type
certification. One-on-one opportunities for more practice, as well as for recertification on these instruments, will be provided.


On the final day of training, all interviewers will complete a final walkthrough of the entire process; including introducing the project, completing
the Coverscreen and PCG, consenting and completion of the Child interview
and Time Diaries, completing the OCG and completing all observations and
final call notes. Feedback will be given to the interviewers on any weak
points. All certification on the Child interview and assessments must be
completed before leaving training.


Production on CDS-III will begin on October 1, 2007. Immediately after
training, your bulk supplies will be shipped and you will have time to get
organized and review your sample. This is also a good time to carefully
review the information provided in the Respondent Profiles. This information
will give you an opportunity to get to know your sample and begin
formulating some ideas on approaches that may be successful.


Your work plan should be based on meeting the required production goals.
Knowing in advance how you will attack your assignment will maximize
your efficiency and cost. Organize your sample so that you can work in large
blocks of time, whether that is on the phone or traveling. Map out the most
efficient way of traveling to your household visits. Review of the Profiles
will help in your planning and scheduling of the cases you will begin working
first.


In your materials we have provided you with a letter that you can deliver to
the local police, the Better Business Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, etc.
explaining our presence in the area. In most cases because the CDS sample is
so dispersed, you will need to have this to provide only when you are asked.
Suggest to the local authority that they file the letter under “University of
Michigan” and not “ISR”. Too often ISR is confused with IRS. You should
keep a couple of letters in your bag at all times. If additional information is
requested, please notify your Team Leader.

all times. If you become concerned in any situation, leave it at once. Please
refer to your General Interviewer Training manual for tips on safety in the
field.

**PART B: CONTACTING RESPONDENTS AND TRACKING**


**Introduction** The success of this study depends on locating and interviewing every
respondent. High response rates, along with quality data, are necessary to
maintain the integrity of the study and researchers’ ability to apply the
findings to the general population. Each respondent is extremely important
and is representative of thousands of others who live in the United States.


In addition, CDS and PSID are panel studies that interview the same
respondents again and again, so it is crucial that we reach each eligible
respondent who was interviewed for CDS in 1997 or 2002. CDS-III
respondents were also interviewed for PSID in 2007. Information from
previous CDS and PSID interviews will be valuable to you in your efforts to
contact respondents.


Our goal will be to interview the 1835 Children in 1433 Households identified
as eligible for CDS-III.


This section of the manual will give you specific guidelines to follow that will
assist you in locating lost respondents.


**Non-Response** People are becoming more reluctant to participate in surveys. Losing the
representative nature of the survey due to high non-response is something that
is taken very seriously—the validity of the study will be challenged if we
experience a high percentage of non-response.


We must identify the reasons that respondents are reluctant to participate, but
it is difficult to tease out the issues that play a part in non-response. The more
detailed information we can gather about the circumstances of our
uncooperative respondents, the better we can make adjustments that will lead
to greater success in future waves.


While non-response is a critical issue for all studies, it is even more so with a
panel study. Meaningful results are only possible when we are able to observe
the same people over a long period of time. If we fail to retain a very high
percentage of our respondents, we jeopardize our ability to observe real
change, and become unable to provide the information CDS was designed and
funded to address.


After being interviewed multiple times, respondents may question our need to
interview them again. It is essential that we listen to and tackle every concern
expressed by respondents. We need to fully explain why we conduct panel
studies and the importance of their continued participation; although their
situation may not have changed, the circumstances of other people’s lives
have. Only by combining their answers with others’ can we establish a broad
picture of how the country as a whole is changing. When possible, we will

make eve1y effo1i to have the same interviewer on PSID 2007 and CDS-III,
but it may be helpful for you to point out that the CDS interview is different
from their regular PSID interview because it incmporates interviews of
children as well as the adults in the family who are n01mally interviewed
during PSID.


When contacting respondents, the objective is to make each contact as
efficient as possible and minimize your time on the phone or on the road
during unproductive times.


Using data from Call Notes, we have ranked the following time slots
according to likelihood of finding someone at home:


**Preferred Contact Times**



We have al so **1** . d f fi d th b t en 1 1e e es an d wors t t 1me s o s or a 1 t £ tt emp m t g contact:


**Best and Worst Contact Times**


Best **Monday** **7pm-9 pm**
Worst **Friday** **9 am-12pm**


Call Notes about a contact or attempted contact with a respondent are another
invaluable interviewing tool. **As the Interviewer it is your responsibility to**
**provide complete, relevant and useful information in the Call Notes for**
**each of your cases.**


Many people depend on the Call Notes to gain an understanding of the
interaction between the respondent and the Interviewer, which in tum is used
to make adjustments in future waves of the study.


Call Notes are also analyzed to provide insight into successful or unsuccessful
data collection effo1is. They identify calling patterns that are most successful
both by region and by types of respondents. Areas of non-response can be
addressed by modifications in presentations of questionnaire content and
materials.


When you review the previous wave's Call Notes, or Profiles, think about
what you wish had been recorded-what would have helped you better

understand your respondent. Then include that level of detail for the next
Interviewer in your Call Notes.


**What to include in call notes**
The call notes should include information about the respondent, the
household, contact persons, and informants. This may include information
that you specifically ask for and things that you pick up incidentally.


**The respondent or informant’s name.** This is essential in making contact
with the correct person on the next call.  This can include nicknames, aliases,
or maiden names.


**Other personal information.**

  - relationship between the informant and the respondent

  - gender

  - age

  - marital status

  - first and last name of spouse, partner, roommates or friends

  - last known address, telephone number, or employer

  - vacation homes and other residences

  - names of trailer courts, apartment complexes, and neighborhoods


**All telephone numbers** that are used in trying to contact the respondent or
informants.


**What was said by the Interviewer.** How much and what kind of information
you gave to the respondent/informant.


**What was said by the respondent.** Note any concerns that were expressed
and whether or not your response seemed sufficient to allay the person’s

concerns.


**Action to be taken in future calls.** If an appointment was set, note the time
and date. Indicate whether this was a firm appointment or simply a suggested
time to call back.


**Other suggestions that might help get the interview.** The respondent’s
normal working hours or household routines that might interfere with
obtaining an interview (e.g., meal times, children’s schedules, etc.).


**Answering machine messages.** The first time you hear an answering
machine or recording, write a brief summary of the recorded message. Make
note of any changes to that message in the future.


**What NOT to include in call notes**


**Judgmental statements.** Call notes should never contain judgmental

statements, which could be interpreted as damaging to the informant or
prejudicial to other Interviewers. Problems should always be documented in
an objective and neutral tone. If you are in doubt about how to record a
situation, consult with your Team Leader.


High response rates, along with quality data, are necessary in defending the
integrity of a longitudinal or panel study and researchers’ ability to apply the
findings to the general public. Each individual respondent is extremely
important to the study as he or she is representative of thousands of others who
live in the United States.


**The primary responsibility for tracking a respondent lies with the**
**interviewer initially assigned the case** . This means that it is crucial that
interviewers start early, identifying all cases in their sample that may require
tracking. Interviewers are expected to be proactive in working the tracking
cases, since some cases may take a few weeks to resolve.


The details of the tracking activity will be entered in the CaseTrak module of
SurveyTrak. See instructions on using CaseTrak in the CaseTrak section of
your SurveyTrak manual. It is of utmost importance that interviewers enter
detailed notes in both Call Wizard and CaseTrak to facilitate the successful

search for a lost respondent.


The National Tracking Team (NTT) consists of one member for each
Production Coordinator’s work group. The purpose of the NTT is to monitor,
coordinate and direct the national tracking effort.


Each member is well trained in the tracking procedures and strategies to locate
lost respondents. NTT will be reviewing all tracking cases and working with
Team Leaders and interviewers to develop good tracking habits.


**The first step in contacting a respondent or proxy is, typically, to** call the
telephone number **listed in SurveyTrak.**


If the respondent’s telephone number has been reassigned or disconnected, or
the respondent no longer lives at the preloaded address, enter a call record in
Call Wizard, assign a tracking code ( ), and document the reason
you have determined the respondent is lost. This will automatically launch the
CaseTrak window to remind you to record all subsequent tracking activities in
CaseTrak.


Once a case is assigned a tracking status code, it remains in the tracking
category ( ) until you or an NTT member have
located the respondent or proxy.


96


**General**
**Suggestions for**
**Tracking**



The necessity of study knowledge cannot be overemphasized. If you are
familiar with the material in your project manual and the Respondent Profile,
this knowledge will build your self-confidence when speaking with
informants.


At each wave of data collection we asked respondents completing interviews
to provide us with the names and contact information of two individuals who
would always know of their whereabouts in the future. Contact people are
always our most valuable tracking resources. Take time to plan what you are
going to say before you interact.


No matter how close the informant is to our respondent, even if you are
speaking to another CDS respondent, it is a breach of confidentiality to
identify a respondent as participating in our study. Do not name the study and
do not identify the respondent as participating in our study. You may ask
questions, but never reveal any information about a respondent.


 - Establish a dialogue and consider the first impression you are making.

 - Try to make the informant feel as if he or she is the most important
person you will meet or talk with today and is vitally important to the
success of our research.

 - Record everything an informant tells you verbatim in your call record
and make note of nonverbal clues.

 - Focus on the informant as an individual. Assume that the informant
wants to help, but may be facing his or her own problems. An informant
may be busy or not want to betray a friend’s confidence. He or she may
not know where the respondent can be located or may be concerned
about passing this information on to you. Determining when such issues
may be at play will help you to more effectively interact with the
informant.

 - Use phrases that elicit cooperation if an informant seems hesitant:

`o` _Last time we spoke with [respondent] he/she told us you are the_
_person who would always know how to locate him/her._
`o` _I know this is an unusual request._
`o` _You are more familiar with your neighborhood (professional field_
_or city) than I. What would you suggest I do to locate_

_[respondent]?_
`o` _There are so many agencies in the (state/county/city) system. Can_
_you recommend another resource, which could help us locate_

_[respondent]?_

 - Other questions to ask:

`o` _Did the respondent belong to a church nearby_ _?_
`o` _Was she/he active in community organizations?_
`o` And most important, the final questions to ask _: Is there anyone else_
_who could help us locate the respondent? Do you know the names of_
_family members or friends who can help us? Was the respondent_
_friendly with any of the neighbors? Who else might know?_

 - Finish every informant contact with something positive, even if it is
nothing more than your suggestion he or she give our request some more
thought. Even if the informant cannot help you, be pleasant and sincere
in thanking him or her for taking the time to talk with you. Never forget
that you may need to contact him again.
`o` _I can understand your reservations about giving out_ information on a
close, personal friend without checking with him first. Why don’t you
contact [respondent’s name] and I’ll call you back in a few days.
`o` When we last spoke, you told me [respondent’s name] called you
every two or three months. You gave me permission to follow-up
occasionally. I was hoping you have heard from him and would have
his new telephone number or address.


While the appropriate tracking strategy for locating an individual respondent
will vary, the basic principles remain the same for all. Special field procedures
have been implemented for CDS in order to ensure that tracking remains a
priority and that the comprehensive effort that is needed to locate each
respondent is achieved. Tracking is a joint effort between Field Interviewers
and the National Tracking Team, with each group assigned specific steps in
the tracking process. And as in the previous wave, sample lines will be
transferred between the interviewer and the NTT member so that whoever is

completing the tracking steps has the line in his or her sample while working.


It is important that tracking cases be _identified early and worked thoroughly_,
since it may take a few weeks in some cases to locate the respondent and
obtain the interview. For this reason, your first three to five tracking cases
must be reviewed with the NTT member for proper procedures and entries in
both Call Wizard and CaseTrak. To assure that all steps are followed, you may
be asked to attend a retraining session set up by phone conference call.


98


**CaseTrak** You will be able to access CaseTrak through SurveyTrak. CaseTrak is
accessed through the Call Wizard and is CaseTrak automatically launched
upon entering a Call Record containing a tracking result code
. Once CaseTrak has been accessed you will be able to enter the
information necessary to track your respondent.


1. The tracking checklist for interviewers is predefined in CaseTrak.
This format makes it easier to detail the Steps and Actions you conduct
in tracking your respondents.


2. Under each Step, respondent, and contact persons address and phone
information has been preloaded from the View/Edit Tabs when you
Insert Action.


3. Access the Respondent Profile directly from CaseTrak by selecting
"Profile" on the bottom toolbar.


The following page will summarize the tracking steps shown in CaseTrak and
on your Interviewer Tracking Checklist.


**Summary of**
**The First 24 Hours after determining respondent, or informant is lost:**
**Tracking Steps**

            - Complete the initial basic tracking steps. Verify respondent or proxy
telephone numbers first by:



*80% of lost

cases are

found in the

first 24 hours

of tracking


*An

additional

10% are

found in the

next two

weeks!




       - checking the Area Code list to confirm the correct area
code,

       - then with Directory Assistance,

       - make the initial contact attempts to any contact persons
during the first 24 hours.

  - If tracking in the first 24 hours is unsuccessful, mail the Basic
Tracking Letter immediately to the respondent’s last known address

  - Accurately maintain CaseTrak notes for each tracking step.


**–**
**The Following Two Weeks** **still working in CaseTrak:**


  - Continue to attempt contact with the respondent using any un-reached
numbers or new numbers provided by directory assistance. Try for
contact using each of the four Preferred Call Slots in the Contacting
Respondents section (section V) of this manual.

  - Continue to call contact persons or informants who have not been
reached using the preferred call slots.

  - Track the contact persons if necessary. Check the area code list first,
then call directory assistance for help with any disconnected or wrong
phone numbers for contact persons or informants.


   During this period, also review the Respondent Profile in detail,
searching for any difficult telephone numbers or informants.

  - Actively work all steps within two weeks and enter any results in

**At the End of Two Weeks:**


  If the respondent has not been reached after two weeks of trncking,
discuss the case with your Team Leader. Enter the results of this
discussion in CaseTrak.

  If instmcted to do so, contact the NTT member. Transfer the case to
NTT for fmther searches, but before the transfer enter a summary of
the tracking
the reason for trnnsfer in a Call Wizard entiy,
assig series result code (Tracking by Tracking Team). As
**n** ig a
a general m ree brief descriptions should appear in this summaiy:

1. What you did to locate the respondent
2. What was the result
3. Y om suggestions for the next tracking steps

  Once you know to whom you will be ti·ansferring the line, you will
need to enter in case notes the date of the ti·ansfer, your interviewer ID
number and the ID number of the interviewer who wil
the lines. A brief note such as "4/1/05: Transfer from
will suffice.

  You must send an email to the NTT member receiving the line with a
cc to yom TL. The subject should be the SID.


There will only be a few enti·ies in Call Wizai·d for a ti·acking case, perhaps
only one if you find the respondent following the steps in CaseTrak. All
actions that you take to locate a respondent will be entered in CaseTrak.

The following is an example of call records in Call Wizai·d for a ti·acking
case ti·ansferred to NTT and back to a field interviewer.


Only three entries in Call Wizai·d, all others will be in CaseTrak:

series for inte1viewer ti·acking,
and
Tra!kinJ result codes are found in the
series for NTT work. Please refer to the Result Codes section of
the manual for more detail on Call Wizai·d enti·ies.


Upon transfer of the line, the NTT member will review the case and will
follow a NTT Tracking Checklist, adding several steps and actions to


100


**Face-to-Face**
**Tracking**



CaseTrak. If successful in finding the respondent, NTT will also complete
the IW if possible. However, if the respondent is found to have relocated and
the Preferred mode for the case is FTF, the line will be transferred to the
nearest available interviewer.


When NTT returns the case to you (the next two weeks):


 - The NTT member will provide new information about possible phones
and addresses for the respondent, proxy, informants or contact persons.
Follow up on these steps and document your actions in CaseTrak.

 - Visit housing units of respondents, contact neighbors, landlords or other
informants as outlined in new steps added in CaseTrak by the NTT
member.

 - As you complete the calls necessary to either obtain the interview or to
follow-up on the provided steps, you will document this work in
CaseTrak, until you have spoken with either the respondent, proxy or a
member of their household.


Additional Tracking Steps:


 - If all the steps in the NTT tracking strategy are completed in CaseTrak
and the respondent is not located, the NTT member and interviewer
assigned to the case will re-evaluate the results. The goal of the PSID
tracking effort is to complete the initial strategy in four weeks, and if
appropriate, a more extensive tracking strategy will then be
implemented. Second-line tracking steps might include face-to-face
work such as trips to contact peoples’ homes or a visit to the local
voting records office.


**Remember, once a case is assigned a tracking status code in Call**
**Wizard, it remains in the tracking category (** **series or** **series)**
**until you or a NTT member have spoken with the respondent, or a**
**knowledgeable adult member of the his/her household.**


Permission for face-to-face tracking must first be obtained from your team
leader and your PC acting on the advice of the NTT.


Face-to-face tracking is extremely effective! Some individuals, businesses or
government agencies are more likely to volunteer information to an
individual standing in front of them than to the voice on the telephone.
Consider the merits of visiting informants who may have said they “don’t
know anything” about the respondent over the telephone. Also, the
respondent may still be at the same address, or there may be an informant at
the address that will know where the respondent has moved. Don’t forget to
talk to neighbors, as they can be a very valuable source of information.


When you talk with informants face-to-face it is important to obtain as much


101


information as possible. Remember to use the same probes with informants
that you would use when interviewing a respondent, with one addition. If the
informant says “I don’t know” remember to ask the important follow up
question “Who might know?”


Before you set out, make sure you have a well thought-out plan to maximize
effectiveness and minimize costs. Remember to record the information from

the Tracking Form in a CaseTrak action as soon as you return home.


At all times when doing face-to-face tracking, an interviewer should clearly
display his or her identification badge and be willing to allow the informant
to review the Institute for Social Research’s “Policy on Safeguarding
Respondent Privacy.” Be prepared to leave Sorry I Missed You Card where
needed. Be sure to explain that, not only do we protect the respondent’s
confidentiality, but also that of the informant.


Work closely with your TL and NTT member in deciding what course to
follow in field tracking as these efforts can quickly become costly. They will
inform you which of the actions listed below seem most likely to bring you
success. These may include:


 - Visit the last known address and talk to neighbors on both sides and
across the street. Ask neighbors for names of a landlord or rental agent.

 - Talk with the landlord, building manager, or realtor.

 - Ask at local stores, bars, churches, or schools.

 - Talk with letter carriers, delivery persons, or Meals on Wheels.

 - Visit local, county and state government offices, which may include:


**Town clerk:** In a small town, the clerk may be helpful in providing address
information from city services, such as trash collection.


**Chamber of commerce:** Again, a good source in a small town.


**Local library:** Cross reference or “crisscross” directories allow you to find a
phone number if you have an address, and you can also find numbers for
neighbors. This service is not available in all areas.


**Voter Registration:** Election records of registered voters, often available on
computer, usually need date of birth.


**Motor vehicle registration:** This may be called Department of Motor
Vehicles. Not available in all states. May list vehicles owned and address.


**Driver’s license bureau:** May also be called Department of Motor Vehicles.
Not available in all states. Will need date of birth, or at least a close guess at
the age—some clerks are more helpful than others. Usually a fee of $3.00 or

so.


102


**County appraiser’s office or local tax examiner:** Rich source of
information about property ownership and tax records. A good way to find a
landlord when you are seeking a renter, or to find a mailing address for
absentee property owners.


**County recorder’s office:** Look for marriage, birth, and death records.


**Local utilities** (water, sewer, trash collection)


**Sheriff’s office**


**Local office of Department of Health and Human Services:** Ask to speak
to the respondent’s case worker who can relay a message to the respondent.
(A social security number will probably be needed. Since PSID does not ask
for or use Social Security numbers, give the name and the last known address
of the Respondent.) A case worker may not give out the respondent’s address
or phone number! Hint: Do not contact case workers the 29th of the month to
the 3rd of the next month nor the 15th to the 18th of the month, or Mondays
or Fridays as these are the generally busy times for them.


Again, be discreet when contacting these offices. Do not reveal the name of
the study.


Careful records need to be kept of all these efforts. Not all of these sources
are available in all locations and there is a charge for some of them. Sources
should be cultivated and thanks given for even a small amount of
information. A thank you note goes a long way toward building a good
working relationship.


103


**Tracking**
**Resources**



**Finder’s Fee:**
A $10 finder’s fee may be offered to a contact person or other informant when
the interviewer believes that it will persuade the informant to provide a
respondent’s address or telephone number or encourage the informant to
persuade the respondent to get in touch with us. Remember that finder’s fees
are paid only after the interview is successfully completed. Even if the finder
gives us accurate information that leads to locating the respondent, the
finder’s fee is not issued unless the interview is complete. When offering a
finder’s fee to an informant, be sure to explain it accurately and to record your
offer in a CaseTrak note.


**You will need approval by your TL to offer a finder’s fee.**


Service Requested envelopes have been included in your bulk supplies and
additional quantities may be requested from the supply line. This
endorsement will alert the post office that the sender wants to know the new
address if the addressee has moved. Upon receipt of an undeliverable mail
piece, the post office will check its files for forwarding address information.
If this information is on-file, the post office will forward the letter or package
on to the respondent and make a photocopy of the old and new addresses that
they will send to the return address on the mail piece. When such mail is
received in Ann Arbor, survey management staff will notify interviewers of
the results.


**In order to facilitate this process, please remember to include your**
**interviewer ID and the** **project number on all envelopes you**
**send. Also write** **near the address so that the Production**
**Manager will receive the returned mail.**


All results passed on from Ann Arbor must be documented in a new action
under the step heading “Send Tracking Letter” in CaseTrak.  The call note
information update will include the following information:


 - Updates from correspondence

 - Date the update was relayed to the interviewer

 - Date and type of initial letter


104


**Finalizing A Case**
Unfortunately, some respondents cannot be located. When you conclude that
**As “Lost”**
all tracking steps have been exhausted, you should first discuss the case with
your Team Leader before contacting the NTT member.


If the NTT member agrees with your assessment that all tracking steps have
been taken, you will enter a final call record in Call Wizard using a status
code Tracking Exhausted. Include the name of the NTT member in
this record’s call note; briefly explain the tracking steps that were taken and
any perceptions or suggestions that may lead to locating the respondent in
future waves.


**Confidentiality** The importance of locating respondents is critical to the success of any study.
However, the need to locate a respondent never outweighs ISR’s policy on
confidentiality.


You must strictly adhere to the Institute for Social Research’s (ISR) Policy on
Safeguarding Respondent Privacy in all tracking efforts. **ISR extends a**
**promise of confidentiality to respondents who participate in its surveys.**
**We pledge to safeguard respondent privacy, anonymity and**
**confidentiality. The Institute takes this obligation very seriously and**
**requires all Institute staff to sign a pledge promising compliance with the**
**policy. Failure to comply with the policy may result in discipline up to**
**and including termination of employment.**


You are reminded that any data obtained in response to survey questions
during an interview with a respondent cannot be used in the tracking process.
Any information a respondent provides from the time an interviewer reads the
questionnaire’s confidentiality statement until he or she begins asking for
recontact information is considered part of the interview and is, therefore, off
limits during the tracking process.


Most information in Interviewer Observations cannot be used to locate a

respondent. This includes but is not limited to occupation, household
members’ names, social benefits received and future plans.
Information obtained during the recontact questions may be used to track a
respondent.


You must understand that releasing an informant’s name, repeating
information one informant gave you to another, or acknowledging that an
informant was unable to provide you with information on the respondent
violates ISR’s commitment to confidentiality, unless the informant has given
you explicit permission to do so.


During the tracking process, an interviewer may talk to several informants
who will give him clues to assist in locating the respondent. Never say, “I
already spoke with your aunt and she doesn’t know where [respondent] is
either!” Learn to use phrases like, _“Another person felt confident you could_


105


**Documenting**
**Tracking Calls**



_help us_ locate [respondent],” or “I understand you have on-going contact with

[respondent],”and then move on to the questions. Under no circumstances,
should you reveal the name of the study to a contact person or other
informant.


It is critical to the tracking effort that, together, the records in Call Wizard and
CaseTrak reflect every step taken to locate a respondent.


The value of well-documented call records cannot be overstated. Call records

should contain concise, detailed information about each contact or attempted
contact with the respondent, contact persons or informants as well as
suggestions for what to do next. Include the relationship to the respondent, and
any other clues that may lead us to success.


**We cannot emphasize enough the importance of documenting every**
**contact you make with informants and contacts, as well as any written**
**correspondence that is used in the tracking process in CaseTrak. Refer to**
**the CaseTrak section of the SurveyTrak manual for instructions on**
**entering CaseTrak actions.**


While documentation may seem to slow the tracking process, it is invaluable
in analyzing what works effectively and in reminding yourself (and other
interviewers or NTT, if the case is transferred) what steps have been taken.

**PART C: PRODUCTION ISSUES**


The field staff structure for CDS is designed to promote an atmosphere of
team spirit, diversity, and productivity with the focus on a national team
effort. This environment will allow flexibility in managing the sample and
providing the needed support to the Interviewers and to the project demands.
To accomplish this, the field staff will be divided into work groups each
headed by a Team Leader and including approximately 10 Interviewers.


The Team Leaders will work with 2 Production Coordinators,
and, to manage production during the field
period.


In the Ann Arbor office, there are a variety of people providing overall
management and support of CDS, and working closely with the field staff.
Here is the Ann Arbor management team:


  -, Production Manager

  -, Survey Director


This organizational structure requires cooperation and interdependence. A
major benefit of the field staff working closely with the Ann Arbor staff is
that we all gain the ability to understand, communicate and implement the
necessary project activities to better meet the goals and challenges of the
study.


All interviewers are required to attend a team conference call once a week.
More information on team calls will be provided at training.


Each interviewer will be asked to sign a Commitment Statement prior to
coming to training, outlining standards for Interviewer training and job
performance while working on the CDS-III. A copy of the signed
Commitment Statement will also be provided for you for your files.


Our overall national production goals for CDS-III are as follows:


**Overall Household response rate is 91%**
**PCG response rate is 91%**
**Child Interview response rate is 91%**
**Time Diary response rate is 91%**
**OCG response rate is 85%**


We will complete approximately 1650 completed interviews. Our average
hours-per-interview or HPI goal is 17 hours (for an entire CDS household).


107


**Reviewing and**

The milestone dates for production are:


  - 10/1/07  Begin Production

  - 12/15/07 80% complete

  - 2/29/08  100% complete


You will receive a copy of the national weekly production goals that you
should keep close by your work area. Refer to this production goal chart and
your work team goals as you monitor your progress during the course of the
project.


If you are not meeting the established goals, please work with your Team
Leader to make any adjustments that may be necessary to help you reach the
goals. You will find your Team Leader to be an invaluable resource
providing suggestions and encouragement based on their successful
experiences and “field-tested” methods.


Your Team Leader is always available as a resource. Throughout the course of
the study, you will have weekly pre-arranged contacts with your TL. To make
the most efficient use of your time on this call, be sure to have all of your
materials and questions prepared prior to the call. These sessions are designed
to provide you with the support you need. This includes reviewing your
individual completion rates, answering questions, discussing strategies for
properly working your sample, and celebrating your accomplishments!


You will need keep track of your cases in Survey Trak and report your
progress to your Team Leader. In addition, it is extremely important that you
send and receive in SurveyTrak once per day in order to transmit your data
and other information to Ann Arbor and your Team Leader and to receive any
information that the Ann Arbor office or your Team Leader will send to you.


Your Team Leader, Production Coordinator, and Production Manager are
your immediate supervisors and should be your first contacts if you need
help. However, other staff members in Ann Arbor are available by phone or
email to assist and support you throughout production. Although we are
always available to help, you should contact Data Services Staff in particular
if your TL, PC, or PM has instructed you to do so or if you have an
emergency arise in the field and your TL, PC, and PM are unavailable.


A DCS staff contact list is provided to you at Registration.



**Quality Control** There are a number of ways in which we monitor the quality of our data
collection efforts. Our definition of quality embodies many aspects ranging
from the interviewing team, the questionnaire and support materials,
performance of the questionnaire application, management of the sample, and


108


the data that is collected. We all share responsibility for the quality of all
aspects of the data collection process. Below are some of the specific
responsibilities that each of us shares in this process.


**Evaluation** For CDS-III, we will have interviewers tape certain interviews for review and
evaluation. Each interviewer will be evaluated throughout the course of
production. Formal evaluation will take place near the beginning of
production to ensure that each Interviewer has mastered the skills necessary
for the study. Particular attention is paid to maintaining GIT standards in
probing, feedback, and question reading. This evaluation will consist of two
portions.


1. Recording: Each Interviewer will be required to record two CHILD and
three PCG Blaise interviews with the respondent’s permission.


Interviewers should indicate in SurveyTrak (in the View/Edit feature, Control
Tab; see _Section 2: SurveyTrak_ for details) when the interview was recorded.
The first tape will be sent to your TL for evaluation and feedback. After that,
tapes will be sent directly to the SRC QC team in Ann Arbor. TLs will
provide the Interviewers with feedback about the recorded interview. The
TL, PC, PM or the SRO Quality Control staff may request additional
recorded interviews as needed.


2. Review of Time Diaries: Each Interviewer will be required to send their
first three sets of Time Diaries to their TL for review each of their first 3

interviews.


Interviewers should indicate in SurveyTrak (in the View/Edit feature, Control
Tab; see _Section 2: SurveyTrak_ for details) when the Time Diaries are mailed
to their TL. TLs will provide feedback and extra instruction as necessary;
additional review of Time Diaries may be requested as needed.


Any Time Diaries that are mailed to your TL for evaluation should be sent
via UPS and tracked. Enter the tracking number in SurveyTrak in the
Control tab of View/Edit. Your TL will evaluate your work and then send
your TD’s to Ann Arbor through the same mailing and tracking process.


**Verification** In accordance with ISR standard quality control procedures, a percentage of
interviews from each Interviewer will be verified. Verification will involve

calling the PCG back to confirm the interview and will be conducted by a
centralized verification team in Ann Arbor. The Interviewer should advise

respondents that someone from the University might be calling them to
confirm their interview.


109


**Respondent**
**Payment**
**Problems**


**Respondent**
**Receipts**


**Incident**
**Reporting**



Whenever a respondent reports a payment problem, such as a check that
cannot be cashed by the respondent, you MUST submit an Electronic
Respondent Payment Form via SurveyTrak in order for the request to be
processed. It is essential that we maintain a “trail” to account for all
transactions that relate to the payment of incentives to the respondents. See
_Section 2: SurveyTrak_ or your SurveyTrak manual for details about
submitting payment requests.


Cash payments for face-to-face interviews are often an effective tool for
getting the interview on the spot. There are also occasions where a
respondent cannot cash a check from us. **If you pay out-of-pocket to your**
**respondent, you must get a signed electronic receipt form in order to be**
**reimbursed through Tenrox.**


You may request a Travel Advance through your TL to cover these expenses.
The receipts will be used to reconcile the Travel Advance.


Separate electronic receipts will be opened in SurveyTrak whenever you
choose the Cash Paid option in any of the interviews (PCG, Child or OCG).


Though all of the University staff make every effort to give you the tools to
protect yourself while you are working out in the field, the fact is that things
may still happen. While working for the University, if you incur any injury
to yourself or to your vehicle, or there is any damage to University
equipment, it must be reported within 24 hours.  You should report the
incident to your TL or PC, who will fill out an Incident Report for Ann
Arbor. You will be asked to give as much detail as possible about what
happened at the time and any subsequent actions. If you are in any doubt
about what constitutes an incident, it is best to report it to your TL for
documentation.

Dear <Parent Name>,



<Date>



The University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research is requesting your family’s participation
in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics—Child Development Supplement. This study has become
one of the most important studies of its kind, providing insights on the various ways in which the
family, school, and neighborhood affect children's and adolescents' development. The study is
designed to collect information from the adolescents in your family who participated in the 1997
Child Development Supplement, and the parents or caregivers of these youth. An interviewer will
be contacting you by telephone, if possible, in the near future, to set up an interviewing
appointment.


We know that our families lead busy lives, and so we’re grateful for your participation. We are
offering the child’s primary caregiver $75 and the other caregiver $20 as a token of our
appreciation for your time, interest, and effort. We would like to give each child who participates
$40 for his/her own contribution. The time you spend talking to us is an investment in a research
study that is very widely used.


We’d like to take this opportunity to stress that participating is completely voluntary. You or your
children may find some of the questions to be of a sensitive nature. If you or they do not wish to
answer them, you can refuse, and your interviewer will move on to the next question. You can also
end the interview at any time, without any questions or consequences whatsoever.


The answers that you give will be kept confidential to the maximum extent allowable under federal,
state, and local law. All identifying information (such as names and addresses) is removed from the
data before it is released to researchers. We never give or sell our list of study members to anyone.


If you have any questions or concerns, please call us at our toll-free number: **.** We
hope you will help us out with this important research project and look forward to speaking with

you soon.

**RESPONDENT DEFINITIONS**


123


124


TOC


**Primary Caregiver:**



**CDS-III RESPONDENT DEFINITIONS**


**FOR PCG AND OCG**



The Primary Caregiver is the main respondent for this study, and will be completing the
Coverscreen, signing permission forms, helping you schedule interviews with the child, completing
an interview about the child (the “PCG-CHILD” instrument) and about the household environment
(the “PCG-HH” instrument), and in some cases, completing the time diaries for or with the child.
By definition, the PCG **must live with the child** .


In most cases, the **PCG** will be the **child’s biological mother** . If the biological mother is not living
with the child, the appropriate respondent is the first person on the following list who lives with the
child:


1. Stepmother, Adoptive mother, or Foster Mother


2. Other female **legal** guardian (Must be at least 18 years of age)


3. Father (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)


4. Male legal guardian of the target child


5. **Final preference** is to take the interview from the person living with the child who is
an adult (at least 18 years of age or older) and takes primary responsibility for caring
for the child. This might be another relative such as a grandmother or aunt. This does
not include someone who is paid or hired to take care of the child (i.e., not a babysitter
or nanny).


We have preloaded the likely PCG based on data from CDS-I (1997) and the 2001 PSID core
interview. It is important to verify who the PCG is because that person may have changed since we
interviewed the family last. Do not make assumptions about the identity of the PCG – the
Coverscreen will guide you through the selection process.


If the primary caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the Interviewer will administer
separate sets of instruments for each child.


125


**Other Caregiver:**


Once you have determined who the actual PCG will be for this study, you will ask the PCG if there
is an Other Caregiver in the household and who that person is. Again, you may need to help select
the Other Caregiver by order of preference. **The Other Caregiver must be living in the**
**Household Unit.** Please note that once someone is selected as the Primary Caregiver he or she can
be selected as another respondent as well. An example would be if the there were two sisters living
together each with their own child. They would both be primary caregivers to their own children
and other caregivers to their sister's children if there was no one else in the household unit that
better fit that description.


The order of preference for the Other Caregiver is as follows:


1. **Father** (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)


2. **Grandmother** of the target child


3. **Boyfriend or Girlfriend** of the primary caregiver


4. **Other Relative** of child who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in the HU. If there
is more than one in the HU, choose the person who has the most responsibility for taking
care of the target child.


5. **Other Non-relative** who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in the HU. If there is
more than one in the HU, choose the person who has the most responsibility for taking
care of the target child. This should not be a paid employee (i.e., not a babysitter or
nanny).


The Other Caregiver **must** be over 18 years of age for all definitions.

Panel Study of Income Dynamics


The Panel Study of Income Dynamics at the University of Michigan is again doing a study on the
development of children. Information from earlier years of the study (1997 and 2002) has already
helped researchers understand how resources in the home, community, and school are connected to
children’s health and achievement. By completing the interview this year, you will help us understand
how these resources affect children’s lives as they develop.  We are asking your permission for your child
to be interviewed.


  - Each child interview will take about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. The child will complete an achievement
assessment. The interviewer will also ask your child questions about family, school, and
neighborhood experiences. We will also ask the child to answer some questions about puberty.
Finally, we will collect the time diaries previously sent to you.


  - Even after you agree for your child to be interviewed, he or she may choose to stop the interview at
any time. If your child is asked any question he or she does not want to answer, the interviewer will
skip it and move on. The interview can usually be completed in one setting, but we may be able to
do it in more than one if you choose.


  - We will provide your child with $40 to show our thanks for his or her time and effort.


Your child’s privacy is of the highest concern to us. Your interviewer has personally pledged to protect your
child’s privacy. Answers that your child gives us are combined with answers from thousands of other
interviews. **No individual can be recognized from their answers and we never release any personal**
**information about the people we interview.**


Because your privacy is so important to us, we have done something extra to protect it. We have a
Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. Having this means that a court, even
under a court order or subpoena, cannot force us to give out information that could identify you or your
child.


Our privacy policy, including the Certificate, has one exception. If any of the information you give us makes
us concerned about harm to you or others, or about child abuse, we are allowed to tell the appropriate people
or agencies about it.


Finally, the agency that funds this research is the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development. They might decide to audit us. So they may see the information you give us. They are also
bound to protect your privacy by not revealing any information that would identify you.


You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing
information about yourself or the fact that you have been involved in this study. If an insurer, employer, or
other person obtains your written consent to receive research information, the researchers may not use the
Certificate to withhold that information.


141


One of the goals of this study is to understand how school resources affect the child’s academic
achievements and interests.  The researchers plan to learn more about your child’s school by using
publicly available information from the U.S. Department of Education.  This includes information
on school and school district staffing, finances, and student enrollment numbers for all schools in
the U.S. This information is used only in statistical summaries for research purposes.


[ _If Applicable:_ The interview may be audio-recorded, but only with your permission and your child’s
permission. Recordings are made so that a supervisor can review the quality of the interview. Only a special
group of project employees can access recorded interviews.]


Thank you and your child for participating in the Child Development Supplement. Our experience from the
past has shown us that young people enjoy doing the interview. The information gathered is very important.
If you have any questions, please call our toll-free number: .


I have read and been informed about the study. The interviewer has offered to answer
any questions I may have concerning the study. I consent to my child’s participation
in the study.

**PSID FAMILY UNIT (FU) DEFINITION**


151


152


TOC


**PSID Family Unit (FU) Definition**


The following information is a short review of the PSID rules concerning Housing Units (HU) and
Family Units (FU). Please review and contact your TL if you have any questions.


**Family vs. Household**


The PSID distinguishes between the _housing unit_ (a particular physical
dwelling) and the _family unit_, which is the people who live in the housing
unit and qualify as a family by PSID criteria. We abbreviate these two
technical terms as the _HU_, and the _FU_ .


**Housing Unit** The _Housing Unit_, or _HU,_ is a residential dwelling designed for one group of
people living as a family. Each HU usually has a lock on its door to keep out
people who don’t belong to the group. The HU may be a single-family house,
half of a duplex, an apartment in a large building, a trailer, or a room in a
nursing home. Each wave, the family listing that you will do at the beginning
of the interview will list everyone who is living there in the HU. But in some
cases, not all of the people will qualify as part of the FU. To belong to the
FU, a person has to satisfy more criteria than just living there.


**Family Unit** The PSID defines the _Family Unit_, or _FU_, as a group of people _**living**_
_**together as a family**_ **.** At first sight, that might not look much different from
the real-world definition. But it is. Let’s look at the three parts:


**Living together.** First, everyone included in this family/FU must occupy the
same HU. Children who are living elsewhere (college, their own apartment)
may be real-world family, but they are not FU members.


**As a family—related** . Second, FU members must be related. This can be in
one of the real-world family ways, such as blood, marriage, or adoption. But
PSID also counts live-in romantic partners (boyfriends, girlfriends, same sex
partners) as FU members. Someone who is not related in one of these ways is
not eligible to be in the FU.


**As a family—economically.** Finally, FU members are economically
interdependent. Sometimes relatives may be living in the HU, but not really
financially integrated into the family—usually because they are only there
temporarily. So even though they satisfy the first 2 criteria, they are not
included in the FU.


FU members occupy the same HU. But there may be some people living in
the HU who do not qualify for FU membership. Anyone who is living in the
household but who does not meet the other two criteria for FU membership is
considered an HU member, rather than an FU member.
