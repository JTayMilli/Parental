## Chapter 1 – An Introduction to the CDS

The Child Development Supplement (CDS) is one research component of the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal study of a representative sample of U.S. individuals and the families in
which they reside. Since 1968, the PSID has collected data on family composition changes, housing and
food expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment, income, time spent in housework, health,
consumption, wealth, and more.


While the PSID has always collected some information about children (see the PSID bibliography for research papers on child development 1 ), in 1997 PSID supplemented its main data collection with

additional data on 0-12 year-old children and their parents. The goal of this new data collection was to
improve our understanding of the socio-demographic, psychological, and economic aspects of childhood
from a nationally representative longitudinal perspective. The CDS-I successfully completed interviews
with 2,394 families (88%), providing information on 3,563 children. In 2002-2003, CDS re-contacted
families in CDS-I who remained active in the PSID panel as of 2001. CDS-II successfully re-interviewed
2,019 families (91%) who provided data on 2,907 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years. During 2007
and 2008, 1,506 children aged 10-19 were successfully re-interviewed (90%). For CDS-III, a completed
interview as reported by either the child or the primary caregiver constituted a successful re-interview,
reflecting the older child’s ability to provide self-reported information, as compared with CDS-I and
CDS-II when the children were younger requiring a completed interview from the primary caregiver for a
case to be considered a completed interview.


The CDS gathers a broad array of measures on developmental outcomes across the domains of health,
psychological well-being, social relationships, cognitive development, achievement motivation, and
education as well as a number of measures of the family, neighborhood, and school environments in
which the sample members live and learn. The breadth and depth of measurement offers a substantially
rich resource to study development of children and teens alike from infancy/early childhood through
middle childhood and adolescence.


In addition to the survey measures described above, the CDS-III collected time diaries from the sample
children 10-19 years of age. These diaries provide a basic foundation for understanding how children
across ages, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status engage in a range of activities and social
circumstances. They, additionally, offer an excellent opportunity to investigate research questions that
examine relationships among time spent in various activities, aspects of the family environment, and
outcomes related to achievement, social and behavioral development, and health.


By nature of the CDS being a supplement to the PSID, the study takes advantage of an extensive amount
of family demographic and economic data about the sample children’s family—not only parents, but also
grandparents, siblings, cousins, and other relatives—providing more extensive family data than any other
nationally-representative longitudinal survey of children and youth in the U.S. This rich data structure
allows analysts a unique opportunity to fully link information on children, their parents, their
grandparents, and other relatives to take advantage of the intergenerational and long-panel dimensions of
the data.

Through a separate biennial interview, data are further collected on sample members during their early
years of transitioning into adulthood (TA study) and, in the main PSID, when they leave home and
become heads of their own households. The extensive information collected on experiences during

1 URL: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography


CDS-III User Guide Page 7


childhood and adolescence can then be used to help explain patterns of adult life experiences and
development. Truly, the multi-level, multidisciplinary, and longitudinal nature of the combined PSIDCDS-TA research design make the CDS an important and very unique resource to the research
community. Starting in 2005, and continuing biennially through 2011, the TA study will provide more
information about developmental trajectories into young adulthood.

The goal of this User Guide is to provide detailed information about the overall CDS study design,
specific measures, data structure and relationships with the “parent study” – the PSID. More specifically,
the next chapter, Chapter 2, introduces the CDS-III data collection modules and their relationship to the
CDS-I and II modules. Chapter 3 describes the CDS-III sample and data collection response rates.
Chapter 4 follows with documentation on the sample weight and related issues. Chapter 5 provides
highlights of the data collection efforts and Chapters 6-10 detail the goals and measures in each of the
modules – Primary Caregiver, Child Interview, Assessments, and Time Diaries, Other (i.e., Secondary)
Caregiver and External School Data, respectively. Chapter 11 briefly lists the variables that were coded in
the CDS-III. Chapter 12 provides information about the rich data resources in the PSID main and
supplemental files, the data structure within the PSID, and fundamental aspects of its data structure as
they relate to the CDS respondents. In Chapters 13-15, we continue with more information on data
structure and linking within the various data groups in the PSID-CDS Data Center.

## Chapter 2 – Overview of the CDS-III Modules

All waves of the CDS collect measures of developmental outcomes in the areas of health, achievement,
and psychosocial well-being, and measures of inputs into development within the context of the child’s
family, neighborhood, and school. Due to the panel nature of the study, most measures in the third wave
duplicated those assessed in the first and second to permit analysis of change over time. The CDS-I User
Guide (Hofferth et al., 1999 [2] ) provides an overview of the initial wave and its measures. Changes in the
type and content of the instruments at the second wave largely reflected measurement needs related to
changes in the developmental stages of the children across the data collections, while changes in CDS-III
are mainly centered around the changes due to age differences. In CDS-I, almost all of the participating
children were 0-12 years of age, with a good number not yet in school. The interviews focused on
developmental issues appropriate to the infant, early childhood, and middle childhood stages and
emphasized contacts with caregivers and preschool /elementary school teachers. In CDS-II, almost onehalf of the CDS sample was in adolescence. We added substantially more youth-reported measures, new
adolescent-appropriate scales, such as the Adolescent HOME Short-Form Scale, and more psychological
and educational scales. Additionally, we expanded the interview with the children themselves, and
incorporated many of the new question items in an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI)
whereby adolescents listened to the questions through a headset and recorded their responses directly into
the laptop. This method has been shown to improve data quality for reports of sensitive information such
as questions about psychological well-being, sexual behaviors, and experiences with tobacco, alcohol,
and drug use (Aquilino, 1994) [3] . These elements were continued in CDS-III, and since all of the
respondents were aged 10+, each of the supplemental interview portions was included.


The CDS-III data are collected from multiple individuals using varied methodology but all with a focus
on the sample child and his/her social and physical environment. The CDS modules are, as follows: (1)
Primary Caregiver (PCG) Interview that focused on the child and household characteristics; (2) Child
Interview for children aged 10 years and older, including an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview
(ACASI) component for sensitive topics asked of adolescents; (3) Standardized Educational Achievement
Assessments for all children using the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement and WISC Digit Span
Test; (4) Time Diary for weekday and weekend accounts of use of children’s time filled out by either the
child alone or the child in collaboration with the mother; (5) Other Caregiver (OCG) Questionnaire that
focuses on the child and household characteristics; and (6) External School Database to gather
information about the school and school district environments. Table 2.1 below provides a summary of
the content of the CDS modules. In this chapter, we review the modules included in the third wave.
Chapters 6-10 provide more detail about the specific measures within each module, and Chapter 12
provides details on measures collected in the PSID main family interview.

**Primary Caregiver Child Interview**


In CDS-I and CDS-II, the Primary Caregiver Child Interview (“PCG-Child”) was required for a
sample child to be considered “response”. In CDS-III, a sample child is considered “response”
upon the completion of either the Child interview or the PCG interview. The PCG-Child is an
important anchor of the study as it contains key developmental measures, including almost all of
the HOME SF scale items and other family environment measures, the Behavior Problem Index,
parent-report on schooling and education activities, extra curricular activities, health, and child
expenditures and savings.


As in CDS-I and CDS-II, by definition, the PCG must have lived with the child to be considered
a primary caregiver. In most cases, the PCG was the child’s biological mother. If the biological
mother was not living with the child, the appropriate respondent was the first person on the list of
relationships below who was living with the child:


� Stepmother, adoptive mother, or foster mother


CDS-III User Guide Page 11


� Other female legal guardian (must be at least 18 years of age; oftentimes the
grandmother)


� Father (biological, adoptive, step, or foster)


� Male legal guardian of the sample child


� An adult (at least 18 years of age or older) who lives with the child and takes primary
responsibility for caring for him/her. This does not include someone who is paid or hired
to take care of the child (i.e., not a babysitter or nanny).

We expanded the PCG-Child interview in CDS-III to include new questions fitting with the new
age group of the children. These included questions of future college plans, career possibilities,
and personal expenses, as well as parent/child relationships.

**Primary Caregiver Household Interview**


While the PCG-Child interview focused on the sample child, the PCG-Household Interview
(PCG-HH), in turn, focused on household characteristics (e.g., neighborhood, family rules) and
the PCG’s own psychological resources and social support, parenting values, stresses, and styles,
and beliefs about the parental role in child rearing. This module has remained largely the same
across CDS data collection waves.

**Child Interview**


In CDS-III, all children were age 10 and older, allowing each to participate in the in-home
interview him/herself. For some children who were newly age eligible in 2007, the Child
Interview was a new addition in CDS-III, focusing on: self-concepts for reading and math
abilities, school connectedness, peer victimization and bullying, family relationships, electronic
media use, work experiences (for youth 12 years and older), and future expectations. The Eccles
self-concept items for reading and math and the self-esteem measure were the only measures in
the Child Interview that were also assessed in the CDS-I.

All children, additionally, participated in an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI)
component whereby the children listened to the questions themselves on a headset and then
responded directly into the laptop. All children in CDS-III were able to participate in Section K of
the Child Interview that queried the youth about their hobbies and extracurricular activities,
characteristics of friends, and health behaviors such as dietary, exercise, and sleep patterns. For
youth 12 years and older, the ACASI module included items on the youth’s own savings and
expenditure patterns, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, delinquent behavior, educational aspirations
and expectations, parental monitoring reported from the youth’s perspective, and languishing and
flourishing.

**Assessments**


The assessments in CDS-III replicated those in CDS-II, though they were collected electronically
for CDS-III: physical measurements and achievement tests. Interviewers collected height and
body weight of the children and administered standardized educational achievement tests using
the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Tests of Achievement and the WISC Digit Span Test for
Memory. Height and weight were gathered in CDS-I and CDS-II in the PCG interview and the


CDS-III User Guide Page 12


assessments were included in the “Child Interview”. The physical and cognitive assessments
provide important, high-quality outcome measures for the study. More information about the
assessment administrative procedures and data quality are described in Chapter 8 of this guide.


**Time Diary**


The time diaries are one of the unique features of the CDS design. While the PCG and Child
interviews included stylized questions about the children’s structured and unstructured activities,
and activities with parents and absent parents, the time diaries provide detailed accounting of the
type, number, duration, and location of activities during sampled 24-hour days, beginning at
midnight for one randomly sampled weekday and one randomly sampled weekend day. Using the
time diaries, we additionally collected information on the social context of the activity by
specifying with whom the child was doing the activity and who else was present, but not
engaging.

**Interviewer Observations**


After the in-home interview, the interviewer recorded observed interactions between the primary
caregiver and the child/adolescent and characteristics of the physical environment of the home
and neighborhood. Most of these items are replicated from the HOME Scale Short Form, as used
in the NLSY79 and can be summarized in terms of cognitive stimulation and emotional support.
In CDS-II, we included additional observational items that were not a part of the NLSY79 version
but included in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Study.
Observations are fully described in the appendix under the HOME Scale Specifications. These
procedures were continued in CDS-III and can now be compared across all three waves. In CDSIII, the interviewer observation data is released separately as part of the PCG-Child, PCG-HH,
and Assessment modules.


**Other Caregiver Child and Household Interviews**


CDS-III, as in CDS-II, collected information about the sample child and home environment from
a secondary caregiver in the home (“OCG”), broadly defined as a second person living in the
household who had responsibility for raising the sample child. There has been substantial interest
in the involvement of fathers in the lives of their children. In many low-income households,
however, the second caregiver can often be a grandmother, not a father or partner. The expanded
“OCG” definition in both waves of the CDS permit examination of the contribution of a second
caregiver, more generally, over many other studies that just focus on the father. During data
collection, OCGs were interviewed for 890 CDS sample children (60%). The content of the
OCG-Child and OCG-Household interviews was drawn directly from the PCG interviews and
remain largely consistent across all three CDS data collections.


**School Environment Data**


In CDS-II, we bolstered our data resources that focused on the school environment. These data
were designed to allow researchers to both model school level influences on child and adolescent
development and to control for school level influences when modeling family and neighborhood
level influences on developmental outcomes. We replaced the school administrator interview
from CDS-I with linkages available under restricted contract to the National Center for Education


CDS-III User Guide Page 13


Statistics Common Core of Data and Private School Survey (NCES CCD and PSS). The CCD
and PSS provide access to a broader range of variables about the schools and data at a higher
response rate than the CDS-I School Administrator surveys. These identifiers will also be
released under restricted contract for CDS-III.


**Looking Forward: Following the Full CDS Sample into Adolescence and Young Adulthood**


Since the completion of CDS-II in 2002, the Transition into Adulthood study (TA) has
implemented its first two waves of data collection in 2005 and 2007. This has enabled the
collection of information about the CDS ‘alumni’ who are over 18, out of high school, but not yet
heads of their own households. The purpose of the TA study has been to follow the CDS children
and adolescents until they are independent and join the core PSID study. This will allow for a
progression from multiple stages of childhood through adolescence and into adulthood.

The chart below explains the natural age progression of the CDS children starting in 2005. When
the CDS cohort ages out of the CDS system they continue onto the TA study. The TA study is
currently funded through 2011, with additional data collection planned through 2015, when all
CDS children may be observed in the study.

When the CDS youth become economically independent from their parents, that is, when they “split off” into their own households, they become
eligible for participation in the main PSID family interview, the point in the life course when the PSID begins to collect its most detailed, long
term information on the sample members’ adult health, family, work, wealth accumulation, and more. With the introduction of the TA study there
will no longer be gaps in the life-span, giving a full spectrum of information on some children from age 2 and up.

## Chapter 3 – The CDS Sample

Using sample weights, the CDS is designed as a nationally representative sample of children and
their primary caregivers in the United States. This chapter describes the initial sampling in 1997,

**Re-interview Sample in 2007: CDS-III**


For CDS-III, we essentially followed the sample children of CDS-II whose families were still
active in the PSID 2005 main study. There were minor changes between CDS-II and CDS-III
including:


  - Unlike in CDS-II, a PCG interview was not needed in order for a case to be coded as a
“response” in CDS-III


  - A case was coded as a “response” as long as either the Child interview or PCG interview
had been completed, by either the child or primary caregiver respectively, in CDS-III.


During data collection, there were some situations in which we did not attempt interviews with or
for sample children who met the criteria above. We attempted interviews for the CDS Sample
child if:


� Sample child still resided under the care of a primary caregiver (meaning, he/she
had not yet established own residence);


� Sample child lived in U.S.;


� Sample child did not reside on a military base; and


� Sample child was non-institutionalized.


CDS-III data collection resulted in completed interviews for 1,506 of the 1,676 “followable”
children in 2007 who still met data collection eligibility, resulting in a response rate of 90%. The
reasons for not completing an interview during the CDS-III data collection are specified in Table
3.1.

turned 19 during the data collection period). Age and gender distributions for response children
are highlighted in Table 3.2.

**Data Collection Outcomes for the Individual Modules**


Each CDS sample child could have up to seven modules of data collected from three different
family members as well as a school resource. Eligibility for some modules depended on child’s
age or whether a secondary caregiver resided in the home for the child. Chapter 4 defines the
modules and eligibility in more detail. The table below provides an overview of data collection
response rates per CDS-III module.

## Chapter 4 – The CDS - III Sample Weights

To account for differential probabilities of selection due to the original PSID sample design and
subsequent attrition, CDS data are provided with weights. This chapter describes the construction
of two CDS-III weights and related issues.

The CDS interview has a complex structure involving several modules. These modules are the
Child Interview, Primary Caregiver (PCG) Child Interview (or PCG Child Interview), Primary
Caregiver (PCG) Household Interview, Child Assessment, Time Diary, Other Caregiver (OCG)
Child Interview and Other Caregiver (OCG) Household Interview. In 2007 completion of the
Child Interview or the Primary Caregiver (PCG) Child Interview is the basis for including a case
in the final data set. For each of these two main modules, the CDS-III data are provided with
sample weights which are described below. We will refer to the weight pertaining to the CDS-III
Child Interview module as the CDS-III Child Interview/ Child weight. The weight corresponding
to the PCG Child Interview will be referred to as the CDS-III PCG Interview/Child weight. The
addition of the “/Child” modifier in the names of the weight variables underscores that both
modules provide child level data and both weights are designed to be used for analyses with the
child as the unit of observation. The CDS-III PCG Interview/Child weight is recommended for
use in analyses involving the Child Interview data. The CDS-III PCG Interview/Child weight
should only be used for analyses in which the primary focus is on the data from the PCG Child
Interview module and in which no data from the Child Interview module are used.

The other CDS interview modules are secondary to the Child Interview module and the PCG
Child Interview, and special weights are not provided for the analysis of these modules. The last
subsection in this Chapter provides guidance on how analysts may address the problem of
missing data for other child observation modules.

**Methodological approach**

Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal
probabilities of sample selection and non-response or data that are missing at random (MAR)
(Little and Rubin, 2002). [4] These weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each
observation is selected and, conditional on selection, that individuals respond to the survey
questions. With longitudinal data, this joint probability at time t, where the study has started at t-1
or earlier, can be expressed as following

_P(S_ _t_ _=1)=P(S_ _t-1_ _=1)*P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1)_ _(1)_

where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in a study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at
time _t._ The probability of being a participant at time _t_ is a product of the probability of
participating in the previous period and the conditional probability of being a response in the
current period. As the first term on the right hand side of (1) is proportional to the reciprocal of
the weight in the previous period, the weight in the current period is a product of the weight in
previous period and the inverse of probability of response (the second term on the right hand side
of (1)). We will refer to _1/ P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1)_ as the attrition adjustment factor.

Sons, New York.

**CDS-III Child interview/Child weight and PCG interview/Child weight**

Both CDS-III weights are designed to account for the differential attrition between the first and
the third waves of CDS, i.e. _t=_ 2007 and _t-1=_ 1997. Thus, the CDS-III Child interview/Child
weight is a product of the CDS-I weight, i.e., the individual level primary caregiver/ child weight
(i.e., the weight variable named ‘CH97PRWT’) and the attrition adjustment factor for the CDS-III
Child Interview module. [5] Similarly, the CDS-III PCG interview/Child weight is a product of the
CDS-I weight, CH97PRWT, and the attrition adjustment factor for the PCG Child Interview
module.

It is important to note that a subsample of the original CDS-I sample is now aged 18 and older
and has completed high school and as a result has become ineligible for the 2007 CDS interview.
In particular, the CDS-I participants born before 1989 are not eligible for 2007 CDS. Instead
these respondents would be considered for participation in the 2007 Transition to Adulthood (TA)
study. Out of 3,563 CDS-I participants, 2,091 would satisfy the age requirement for participation
in CDS-III (see Table 4.1). The specific criterion for selection of these 2091 cases is that the
child’s birth date is after August 1, 1989. Selected in such a way, the subsample of children in the
CDS-I represents those birth cohorts who were interviewed in the CDS-III. For these 2,091
cases, Table 4.2 provides their disposition in CDS-III.

To obtain the attrition adjustment factor corresponding to the CDS-III Child Interview, the
probability that a sample person was non-response in the CDS-III Child Interview was modeled
with the logistic model using observations from the Response and Non-response strata (see Table
4.2, column “Child”). The obtained estimates are reported in Table 4.3. The results indicate that
attrition was higher among members of the immigrant sample and those who at the time of the
CDS-I interview resided in non-metropolitan areas. The resulting attrition adjustment factor is an
inverse of the predicted probability of successful re-interview, which is 1 minus the estimated
probability of non-response.

As the final step in the weight development, the newly constructed CDS-III Child interview/Child
weight and PCG interview/Child weight were censored to reduce the influence of extreme weight
values on the variances of sample estimates of population statistics. For each weight variable, the
cases with the weight values in the top percent and in the bottom percent of the weight
distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th] and 1 [st] percentiles of the weight
distribution, respectively.

To examine the CDS-III Child interview/Child weight, we compared weighted estimates for some
basic demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in CDS-I based on the CDS-I
sample and weighted with the CDS-I weight to the estimates for the same variables measured in
1997 but based on the smaller CDS-III Child interview sample and weighted by the CDS-III
Child interview/Child weight. The results of this comparison are provided in Table 4.5. The


CDS-III User Guide Page 22


comparison of the weighted estimates for the baseline CDS-I and follow-up CDS-III Child
Interview shows that the distributions obtained with the CDS-I and CDS-III Child

interview/Child weights are similar, suggesting that the attrition adjustment for the CDS-III Child
Interview compensates for potential attrition bias for variables included in the analysis. It is
important to note, however, that this comparison does not necessarily rule out the possibility of
selection bias associated with other characteristics of CDS respondents. Table 4.6 reports the
results from a similar comparison for the CDS-III PCG interview/Child weight.

The final CDS-III PCG interview/Child weight is stored in the variable CH07WT. The CH07WT
weight is recommended for use in child level analyses involving the Child Interview data.

The CDS-III PCG interview/Child weight is stored in the variable CH07RPWT. The
CH07RPWT weight should be used for child level analyses in which the primary focus is the data
from the PCG Child Interview module and in which no data from the Child Interview module are

used.

The child weight, CH07PRWT, can be converted into a caregiver level weight by averaging the
weights for each CDS-III child observation provided by a caregiver. This PCG/family weight
could be use to develop an analysis that is focused on the caregiver or the family as the unit of
observation/analysis.

**Addressing Missing Data in Other CDS-III interview modules**

Apart from the Child Interview and PCG Child Interview, other CDS interview modules are
secondary and may or may not have been successfully completed. For example, it is possible to
have information on the Child Interview and have missing data for any of the secondary module
interviews. The response rates for each secondary module are given in Table 3.4 (Chapter 3).

Researchers interested in analyzing the CDS-III data for the secondary modules should carefully
examine the extent of the partial missing data problem and address it if necessary. The issue can
be approached in a number of ways. The simplest way is to assume that the data are missing
completely at random (MCAR). That is, given the adjustment that has already been performed for
attrition in the Child Interview sample or for the PCG Child Interview sample, non-response to a
secondary module is completely random with respect to the dependent variables of interest. When
MCAR is the appropriate assumption, analysis of the observed data for the secondary modules
will not lead to biased estimation. The MCAR assumption, however, may be too strong and may
not always be a good approximation for attrition. If the probability of non-response can be
modeled as a function of observed variables such as age or gender, Little and Rubin (2002)
describe the missing data mechanism as missing at random (MAR).


CDS-III User Guide Page 24


When the non-response or missing data mechanism is MAR, one can approach the problem by
either imputing the missing values or constructing additional weighting adjustments using
procedures that take into account variables that predict the probability of a response. Analysts
interested in imputation of missing response data for the CDS secondary modules may wish to
review Raghunathan, et al. (2001) [6] and access the corresponding SAS-compatible imputation
[software at http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/smp/ive/. However, since the missing data problem for](http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/smp/ive/)
CDS-III secondary modules typically involves complete missing data for all variables, analysts
may choose to develop a weighting adjustment to compensate for an MAR missing data
mechanism. The algorithm for constructing these weighting adjustments should be similar to the
one described in the previous section. Here, the logistic regression model of response propensity
in the secondary module in relation to the Child Interview sample or the PCG Child Interview
sample would be estimated based only on characteristics of eligible respondents and nonrespondents, excluding cases that were not eligible for the given module. The new attrition
adjusted weight would be constructed as the product of the corresponding weight, the CDS-III
Child interview/ Child weight or the CDS-III PCG interview/ Child weight, and reciprocal of the
estimated probability of response in the secondary interview.

## Chapter 5 – Data Collection Procedures

The data collection protocol for CDS-III is described in this chapter. More specific details on the
administration of assessments, anthropometric measures, and time diaries are described in
respective chapters that follow.


Data collection for the CDS-III began in the fall of 2007 and extended through May of 2008. We
employed 53 interviewing staff on the study who were extensively trained in all aspects of
general interviewing techniques and study-specific data collection procedures, including unique
protocols to administering the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievements, measuring height and
weight, conducting the HOME scale and neighborhood observations, administering time diaries,
and working with children of all ages. Seventy-four percent of the interviewers had conducted
interviews for the Main PSID 2007 data collection.


CDS employed a mixed-mode interviewing approach to increase flexibility in scheduling
interviews. As mentioned in Chapter 2, each CDS sample child could have up to seven modules
of data collected from three different family members: Primary caregiver (PCG); Secondary
caregiver (OCG); and the sample child him/herself. The PCG Child interview was designated as
the initial interview and could be administered in-person or over the telephone, at the
convenience of the respondent. The other interviews could be taken at various times depending
on the respondent’s schedule (Child interview, PCG Household interview, OCG interview) and
could be conducted in different modes. Time diaries could be administered in-person or over the
telephone and had the added option of self-administration. When time diaries were selfadministered, an interviewer review and editing followed, either in person or over the telephone.
All Child interview components (assessments, height and weight measurements, and ACASI)
were conducted in-person. The OCG interview was conducted over the phone and did not have
the option of being administered in-person.

Table 5.1 The CDS-III Survey Design

|Respondent|Module|Mode|

|PCG7 <br>|Child-Level Interview|In Person or Telephone|

Participating families received between $115 and $135 for their contributions to CDS, depending
on whether there were one or two participating CDS sample children in the family. Primary
Caregivers received $75 for their interviews and Other Caregivers received $20 for their
interviews; each child in the household received $40 for participation.

7 See Chapter 2 for information about the selection protocol for the PCG and OCG.

CDS employed a number of flexible contact approaches to making the survey request. Emphasis
was placed on strategizing how/when the interviewers attempted contact with the respondent over
setting a pre-defined number of maximum contacts. Interviewers tailored their survey
introductions to the respondent’s concerns and individual situations, rather than using a predefined script. During field interviewer training, interviewers were given guidelines and hands-on
practice. This information and experience helped the interviewers address issues that arose on a
family-to-family basis and helped make certain that the family felt comfortable with the wide
array of questions and instruments administered to both the caregivers and children. Interviewers
were given specialized training and a handbook to facilitate response to reluctance to participate
and also were given the option of working with the research staff on tailored persuasion letters for
resistant situations. The refusal conversion rate for CDS-III was 53%, resulting in less than 2% of
the families in a final refusal.


The biggest source of support in reaching response rate goals, however, was the close relationship
to the main PSID study. During the five-year gap in between CDS-II and CDS-III, PSID
interviewed the families of the CDS children (during PSID 2003, 2005, and 2007) and also kept
in touch with them through respondent postcard and report mailings. The PSID achieved a 97.6%
response rate in 2005, and 97% response rate in the 2007 wave, retaining a high proportion of the
sample, which in turn, helped to maintain the CDS sample. CDS was able to capitalize on the
contact information and efforts of that wave of the main study.


During the CDS-III field period, however, some tracking was required. A specialized expert field
tracking team carried out the more involved or complex tracking efforts for the hard-to-locate
families. Seven percent of the sample required tracking at either the interviewer or tracking-team
level. Sixty two percent of the cases that required tracking were located and interviewed. At the
end of the data collection, less than 1% (.8%) of the overall sample was unable to be located.


Team-based interviewing was used for just a handful of the completed households. This was done
in an effort to minimize respondent burden for the in-person Child interviews. In some cases, two
interviewers were sent to a household where two Child interviews needed to be completed. Team
interviewing was also employed when interviewing in dangerous neighborhoods or when there
was enough sample (families) in an area to allow for two interviewers to travel to the area and
complete the interviews in an efficient way.

## Chapter 6 – Primary Caregiver Interviews: Topical Guide

As described earlier, the PCG-Child interview focused on the primary caregiver’s report of the
sample child’s health, schooling, family relationships, and extra-curricular activities, while the
Household interview focused on the Primary Caregiver characteristics and behaviors and the
household environment. This chapter provides more detailed information about the key measures
in the CDS-III Primary Caregiver interviews. Please refer back to the CDS-I and CDS-II user
guides for updates specific to those waves. Appendix A summarizes these measures and provides
the question number references for CDS-I, CDS-II, and CDS-III.  Cross-wave references for
individual items are available in the Cross-Year Index selection within the Data Center.

Questionnaires can also be obtained on the web here:
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/quescodetable.html.](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/quescodetable.html)

**Health**


One of the main additions to the PCG health questions focused around the children’s health
insurance coverage. Not only did the questions ask about whether or not the child had health
coverage at the time of the PCG interview (Q32J50, Q32J53), but also what kind of coverage they
had (Q32J51A-L, Q32J54A-L). The coverage options were quite specific, including:

   - Private health insurance plan provided through my employer (PCG)

   - Private health insurance plan provided through (OCG1, OCG2) employer

   - Private health insurance plan provided through ex-spouse’s employer

   - Private health insurance plan purchased directly

   - Medicaid (specify name)

   - SCHIP (specify name)

   - Medicare

   - Medi-Gap

   - Military Health Care/VA

   - Champus/Tricare/Champ/VA

   - Indian Health Service

   - Other government program

   - Other (ability to specify a choice not given by the choices above)

For the children who were not covered by any health insurance at the time of the PCG interview,
a series of questions were asked about the last time they were covered (Q32J52MO, Q32J52YR,
Q32J55MO, Q32J55YR). This information was gathered not only for Child 1, but also Child 2, if
there were two children for the PCG being interviewed.

After assessing the current health care coverage for each child, the issues of health insurance
price and out of pocket expenses were considered. Questions Q32JA33 and Q32JA34 asked for
specific numerical amounts of money that were spent on medical and dental insurance and out of
pocket medical and dental care (respectively). The question of out of pocket costs did not include
health insurance premiums, over-the-counter remedies, or any costs for which the PCG expected
to be reimbursed. This was specified to make sure that there were not amounts that were included
twice.

Another specific topic that was looked into in CDS-III was childhood obesity. Not only did the


CDS-III User Guide Page 28


child interviews still include height and weight measures from CDS-II and CDS-I, but now both
the PCG and Child interviews include more nutrition, activity, and weight-health oriented
questions. Under the subtext of health, question Q31A4P2 asks whether the child’s doctor or
other health care professional has ever said that the child was obese, over-weight, or at risk of
becoming over-weight. With more research being conducted to categorize and treat childhood
obesity, there is a great need for this type of information. Please see the updates in the following
sections for Nutrition and Child Care for indirect health updates.

**Education**


There are new questions in the PCG interview pertaining to college expenses. These questions
cover several aspects of college expenses including:


  - Full Tuition

  - Partial Tuition

  - Full room and board

  - Partial room and board

  - Books

  - Living expenses

  - Other expenses

  - None

This question (Q31H32F1-8) creates a base for information regarding each child’s future college
plans. Since expenses can be the deciding factor for whether or not a child attends college, it is
very helpful to gain as much information on his/her support system as possible. These
individuals are then followed through the TA study where more college information is collected.
By combining the information from CDS, TA, and the PSID, a big picture can be seen about how
a child’s education, parental ability to support a child’s college expenses, parental income, and
other pertinent factors direct the course of a child’s educational achievement.

From the initial question of what expenses the PCG is planning to cover come questions
pertaining to current savings that the PCG and/or OCG have for these expenses. Questions
Q31H32G and Q31H32H ask if there is any money or assets set aside for the purpose of their
children’s future college expenses.  Additional information about education content in all three
waves of CDS may be found in the CDS-I and CDS-II user guides.

**Child Care**


In Section C of the CDS-III primary caregiver interview, we asked the primary caregiver about all
child care arrangements used during weekday, weekend, and summer. When CDS-I, CDS-II, and
CDS-III data are put together, there should be a fairly complete picture of formal and informal
child care arrangements used from birth up to the age of the child at the time of the CDS-III
interview. Information on arrangements used during weekday, weekend, and summer were
obtained separately. Types of arrangements queried were updated in CDS-III to take the new age
range of the CDS-III adolescents into consideration (aged 10+). This updated breakdown is as
follows:

  - Relative under 13 years old in the child’s home


CDS-III User Guide Page 29


  - Relative 13 or older in the child’s home

  - Non-relative in the child’s home (sitter)

  - Care in a relative’s home

  - Care in a non-relative’s home (family or daycare provider)

  - Before or after-school program

  - Other type of child care

  - Overnight camp (Summer)

  - Day camp (Summer)

In addition to the updated child care choices, more in-depth questions were asked about whether
or not these child care options provided a meal or a snack. These questions (Q31C15C,
Q31C21C, Q31C27C, Q31C33C, and Q31C39C) were added to get a more complete view into
where these children are getting their daily food. With an older sample in CDS-III, there are also
questions regarding part-time/after-school jobs and extra-curricular activities.

**Technology**


Technology is expanding and becoming more accessible as our CDS sample is getting older. For
this reason there is a higher chance for children to have their own technological devices. There is
a new line of questions in the PCG-Child interview directed at this subject. Not only are
questions asked about whether or not the CDS sample children and adolescents have a personal
television or computer in their bedrooms, but also whether or not they fit these criteria:

   - The television or computer are in working order

   - The television has cable or satellite

   - The television has a working VCR or DVD player

   - The television has a working video game console

   - The computer has Internet access

These questions (Q32J28A1-3, Q32J29A1-3, Q32J32A-D), will certainly help in understanding
more of the time diary information collected from the CDS-III children and adolescents. The
Child interview also includes questions about personal cell phones, cell phone use, and other
questions regarding technological time use. Please see Chapter 7 for more details regarding the
CDS-III Child Interview updates.


CDS-III User Guide Page 30


## Chapter 7 – Child Interview: Topical Guide

As of CDS-III, all children were at least 10 years of age which made each of them to be eligible
to participate in an in-home interview him/herself. In this chapter, all new interview questions
will be reviewed. To see the updates for past waves, please refer back to the CDS-I and CDS-II
User Guides. As in CDS-II, the interview content was sub-divided into sections for children of
different ages – the measurement resource table in Appendix A gives details on various measures
throughout the child interview.

**Peer Bullying – Violent Behavior**

Sections H and L were expanded in the CDS-III child interview, including more adult forms of
peer bullying, school violence, and weapon use. While section H covered violence happening to
the child being interviewed, section L asked about his/her own participation in violent acts.

The questions in section H ask whether or not the child has had a gun or knife pulled on him/her
(Q33H1E). If the answer to this question is yes, then two other questions branch from there
asking for the number of times this has occurred (Q33H1F) and where it happened (Q33H1G_14). Q33H1G_1-4 gives much needed insight into the situation, asking whether or not this
incident, or several incidents, happened at school, home, in their neighborhood, or other. The
existing peer bullying questions from CDS-II include questions regarding whether the child being
interviewed has been picked on, hit, stolen from, or purposely left out of activities by his/her
peers (Q33H1A-C). These questions were made into a peer bullying index (H1D), which will
only gain information from the newly added questions in CDS-III.

Section L is reserved for those who are 12 years of age and older. This section of the interview is
administered by Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interview (ACASI). This method is used for the
areas with more sensitive content. Similar to the additions in section H, questions Q33L11B2 and
Q33L11B3 branch out of an existing line of questions from CDS-II. Question Q33L11B asks:
“In the last 6 months, about how many times have you hurt someone badly enough that he/she
needed bandages or a doctor?”. The new questions ask about the same 6 month timeline but ask
whether they have used a weapon in a fight (Q33L11B2) or have carried a weapon at school
(Q33L11B3).

As the CDS-III sample has aged over the past 10 years, different situations arise in each of their
lives. Because of these changes, CDS-III asks more questions in order to stay current with each
stage of adolescence.

**Drug and Alcohol Use and Abuse**


Also added to section L were more in depth questions of personal and peer alcohol and drug use.
Questions were written in three different time styles asking about whether an event had ever
occurred, occurred in the past 30 days, or in the past 6 months. These questions were all focused
on drug and alcohol use in different scenarios including:


   - Have you ever taken prescription drugs without a doctor telling you to take them?
(Q33L15E)


CDS-III User Guide Page 31


   - In the past 30 days, how many times did you take prescription drugs without a doctor
telling you to take them? (Q33L15H)

   - Have you ever taken steroids? (Q33L15J)

  - During the past 30 days, how many times did you take steroids? (Q33L15K)

  - In the past 6 months did you drive when you were drunk or high on drugs? (Q33L13H1)

  - About how often in the last 6 months did you ride with a driver who had too much to
drink? (Q33L13H2)

  - In the past 6 months, about how many times have you brought alcohol or drugs to
school? (Q33L11B4)

These questions were administered to those aged 12 and older through the ACASI system. They
can be analyzed along with questions L12-L15 from CDS-II, which looked into tobacco, drug,
and alcohol use. Each of these questions is helpful in calculating the amount of drug and alcohol
use, or abuse, in this sample.

**Health and Nutrition**

_**Nutrition – Food Consumption**_

As the CDS children and adolescents age, new questions are added in accordance with their new
stages of life. As expected, as the children age into young adults they make more health and
nutrition choices on their own. With assistance from the Economic Research Service of the
United States Department of Agriculture, new questions were added to collect information about
food consumption. Specifically, questions Q33K13A and Q33K13B1-3 ask about drinks and
snacks purchased in school. In addition to snacks that are purchased, a detailed diet catalog is
asked of each adolescent. These questions, namely Q33K13C-M, ask for specifics on diet
including types of food eaten and how often they are consumed. These new questions are in
addition to the food group questions from CDS-II. Instead of asking about general food group
consumption, this line of questions provides additional information about the diet. These include:

Positive Nutrition

    - Milk – Cow’s milk (whole, 2%, skim, low fat or 1%) soy milk, or any other kind of
milk

    - Fruit – Fresh fruit, applesauce, canned fruit, frozen fruit, or dried fruit

    - Vegetables – Fresh vegetables, frozen, soup, stew, stir fry (not including French fries
or other fried potatoes)

    - 100% Fruit Juice – Such as orange, apple, or grape (not including fruit-flavored
drinks like punch, Sunny Delight, Kool-Aid, or sports drinks)

Negative Nutrition

    - Non-100% Fruit Juice – Soda pop, sports drinks, fruit-flavored drinks

    - Sweets – Such as candy, ice cream, cookies, cakes, brownies, or other sweets

    - Salty Snacks – Including potato chips, Cheetos, pretzels, popcorn, and crackers

    - Fast-Food – McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell, or Burger
King (including eating out, carry out, and delivery)

These specific types of food have been singled out to get more information about foods that may
help (milk and 100% fruit juice), or hurt (sweets and salty snacks) the overall well-being of the


CDS-III User Guide Page 32


children and adolescents in the CDS-III study. All of these questions are asked in terms of how
many times in the past seven days these items were consumed. The answer choices are: 1 time
per day, 2 times per day, 3 times per day, 4 or more times per day, 1 to 3 times in the past 7 days,
4 to 6 times in the past 7 days, or never in the past 7 days.

_**Exercise and Body Image**_

Also, in Section K is a new series of questions regarding physical exercise not only for health, but
for the specific purpose of changing one’s appearance. Questions Q33K3C and Q33K3D ask
whether or not the child was involved in any sports teams outside of school and how much time
they devoted to this sport.

Additional questions were asked about ways to control weight. Specifically, questions Q33K10A
and Q33K10BA-M were added for CDS-III. These questions ask whether or not the adolescent is
trying to build muscle or tone their body (Q33K10A), and collect information on other means
they may be using to achieve these goals. These options include:

  - Dieting

  - Eating a special diet

  - Making yourself vomit

  - Exercising

  - Lifting weights

  - Taking diet pills

  - Taking laxatives

  - Taking food supplements

  - Taking steroids

_**Sexual Health**_

In addition, many other adolescent-based health measures were added to CDS-III including:

Both Males and Females

  - Physical development compared to others of the same age (Q33K41)

  - Sexual intercourse (Q33L30C)

  - How many sexual partners (Q33L30E)

  - Frequency of sexual activity (Q33L30D)

  - Sexually transmitted disease concern, testing, and diagnosis (Q33L32D-F)

Females Only

  - Month and year of first menstrual period (Q33K42-44)

  - Age at time of first menstrual period (Q33K45)

  - Birth control pill use (Q33L32)

  - Month and year of first birth control pill use (Q33L32B-C)


CDS-III User Guide Page 33


**Technology**

Our increasingly digital world has not been lost in the CDS questionnaire. Since the collection of
CDS-I in 1997, the use of the Internet and cell phones has increased exponentially. The increased
use of internet and cell phones over the past decade is particularly true for adolescents making it
important to add new questions about this use each wave. In CDS-III an emphasis was given to
cell phones and their use both for calling and text messaging.

Question Q33F3A1 adds to CDS-II’s Internet section by asking about social networking websites
such as MySpace and personal websites. Questions Q33F5A-C and Q33F6A-C quantify usage by
focusing on personal ownership of cell phones, frequency of use, number of minutes used per
month, and number of texts sent each month.

**Outside Involvement**

In all waves of the CDS, interviews with a Primary Caregiver and Other Caregiver are conducted
in order to obtain additional information about the CDS child’s family, parenting practices,
neighborhood, school, health and other domains. The PCG and OCG are often asked about
communication between ‘parent’ and ‘child’ and the same is asked of the child. In CDS-III,
questions Q33H4J-L ask about the specific topics that the child/adolescent discuss with their PCG
and/or OCG. These questions pertain to current coursework, future plans for jobs, and the
possibility of going to college.

In addition to those PCG/OCG focused questions, Q33J33E adds more by asking about school
provided information about college. Some but not all of the options are related to:

  - Level of college needed

  - Available courses/majors at different institutions

  - Scholarships

  - Application and registration

  - Size and location of college

  - Cost of tuition

  - Career training and job possibilities


CDS-III User Guide Page 34


## Chapter 8 - Assessments

As with CDS-I and CDS-II, CDS-III administered two assessment modules: 1) the
anthropometric measures module which measured the child’s height and weight, using tape
measures and scales and 2) the achievements module which measured the child’s cognitive
abilities, using the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Test of Achievement and WISC-III Digit Span.
This chapter gives an overview of the procedures used for collecting these data.

**Height and Weight Measures**


In CDS-I and CDS-II, we gathered reported weight of the child from the Primary Caregiver and
interviewer-measured height of the child, using a rafter square and tape measure (see Section A of
the CDS-I Primary Caregiver-Child interview). In CDS-III, we attempted to measure and weigh
all of the children and youth for whom we were able to get an in-person interview. In the
assessment questionnaire for CDS-III you will find question items for (a) in-person
measurement/weighing by the interviewer or (b) self-report height and weight. Body Mass Index
(BMI) and percentile rank were calculated for all children with height and weight data.


_**Administration Procedures**_

The procedure for measuring height and weight was as follows: To measure the child or youth’s
height, the interviewer asked him/her to take off him/her shoes and stand against a wall or door.
The interviewer placed a Post-it note on the wall right above the child's height, and then
positioned a rafter's square against the wall directly over the child's head. A mark was placed on
the Post-it note at the child's height. When the child moved away from the wall, the interviewer
positioned the tape measure under a door jam or her foot and measured from the floor to the mark
on the Post-it.


To weigh the child or youth, the interviewer asked him/her to empty his/her pockets and remove
his/her shoes, activated the scale and set it to zero. Once the scale showed “0.0”, the child stepped
onto the scale and stood in the center of the scale for 5-10 seconds. The same brand/model of

scale was used for all children:


"Strain-Gauge Lithium Bath Scales" "THINNER MS-7" model
Measurement Specialties, Inc.
80 Little Falls Road Fairfield, NJ 07004
[http://www.msiusa.com/default/index.asp](http://www.msiusa.com/default/index.asp)

Scale Features included:


� High Contrast Digital Display


� Four-digit readout in .5LB increments


� Automatic Zero Set


� Non-slip Platform


� Snap-on carpet feet


� Lifetime lithium battery

If the child or youth respondent refused to be measured or there were physical limitations, such as
child was in a wheelchair, the interviewer asked the PCG to give the height and weight and the


CDS-III User Guide Page 35


date it was last measured at his/her last doctor visit. If the interviewer wasn’t able to take his/her
physical measurements or the information from his/her last doctor visit, they asked for his/her
best estimate.


_**BMI-for-Age**_
While Body Mass Index (BMI) for adults is based simply on height and weight, BMI for children
and teens, also referred to as “BMI-for-Age”, additionally takes into account age and gender. The
reason is that children's body fatness changes over time as they grow, and boys and girls differ in
their body fatness as they develop. BMI-for-age is plotted on gender-specific growth charts for
children and teens 2 – 20 years of age. You can obtain more information on the CDC Growth
Charts at: http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/.

Each of the CDC BMI-for-age gender-specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating
specific percentiles. The percentile cutoff points identify underweight and overweight in children:

Underweight BMI-for-age < 5th percentile


At risk of overweight BMI-for-age 85th percentile to < 95th percentile


Overweight BMI-for-age > 95th percentile


In the CDS-III data, we have included BMI score and percentile score for each child/youth. BMI
was calculated using pounds and inches with this equation:


__       Weight in Pounds _  ____


(Height in inches) x (Height in inches)


BMI = (above equation) x 703


Percentile categories for BMI were calculated based on the CDC growth charts referenced above.
When the CDS-III data are used with the sample weight, the distribution of girls and boys in the
weight percentile categories closely parallels the finding from NHANES 2007-2008. See Table
8.1 for distribution of CDS-III and NHANES 2007-2008 data, for children and youth 10.3-19.0
years of age (note: while all children were 10-18 years of age at the time of screening, some few
had turned 19 by the time the interview was actually completed).

**Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement**

_**Description of the Test**_
Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R) is a well-established and
respected measure that provides researchers with information on several dimensions of
intellectual ability, including current developmental status, degree of mastery in reading and
mathematics, and group standing (either age or grade group). For all three waves of CDS, we
selected and used three subtests as a measure of reading and math achievement: the Letter-Word
Identification, the Passage Comprehension, and the Applied Problems tests (the Calculation test
was additionally administered in CDS-I). These scales can be used individually or combined to
create scores for Broad Reading and Broad Math.

_**Administration**_

The Woodcock-Johnson Revised (WJ-R) Tests of Achievement have standardized administrative
protocols. Since our respondents for CDS-III were older than 6 years old, we administered all
three subtests: Letter-Word Identification, Applied Problems, and the Passage Comprehension
subtest. The paragraphs below provide information on the main procedures for administering
these tests; the user is encouraged to obtain Woodcock-Johnson materials and training (see the
Riverside Publishing website for details that help to fully understand the complete requirements
for the standardized administration).

The WJ-R Test is an ‘easel’ test, a test with a response book that sits in front of the respondent.
The interviewers placed the easel at an angle so that they and the respondents could both see the
stimuli (pictures) simultaneously. Each test required that the interviewer administer it exactly as
described in training and in his/her interviewer manual. Any deviation from these procedures
invalidated the results.

The Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-R) Test of Achievement used:

1. WJ-R easel
2. A laptop to record responses
3. A blank piece of paper for the respondent to write on during the Applied Problems
subtest of the WJ-R

4. Pencils for the respondent.


CDS-III User Guide Page 37


Easel tests were administered in the following order:

   - The interviewer asked the respondent a question or gave direction.

   - The respondent reviewed the options on the page.

   - The respondent pointed to an object or gave an answer.

   - The interviewer recorded the response as correct or incorrect.

Since the WJ-R can be used for respondents from ages 2 to 90 years, items in the WJ-R are
arranged by difficulty for all persons between those ages. The easiest questions are presented first
and the items become increasingly difficult as the respondent proceeded through the test. For
CDS-III, the logic for the administration of the tests was programmed in Blaise (the data
collection software). CDS-III used only the English Form B of the WJ-R. The tests started at the
appropriate starting point based on education level of the child or youth, as the general guideline.
Specifically, the Blaise program used the grade in school the respondent attended at the time of
the interview. At the beginning of every subtest, usually on the first page, there was a chart
organized by grade in school that informed the interviewer at what item they should start
administering the test. To administer the test, the interviewer turned to the page where the starting
item is located.

Raw scores were calculated for the WJ-R using basal and ceiling. The basal and ceiling criteria
were created to limit the amount of time any one person spends on each subtest. When the
respondent got six or more consecutive items correct, then he/she established his/her basal. The
interviewer continued testing until the respondent established ceiling, which was six or more
consecutive items incorrect and the end of the testing page had been reached.

_**Scoring**_

The Woodcock-Johnson Revised (WJ-R) Tests of Achievement have standardized scoring
protocols. The tests are designed to provide a normative score that shows the CDS target child’s
reading and math abilities in comparison to national averages for the child’s age. The normed
scores are constructed based on the target child’s raw score on the test (essentially the number of
correct items completed) and the child’s age to the nearest month. Raw scores are charted on
normative tables based on the child’s age and what percentile the child falls into. The child’s age
at time of testing was calculated by comparing their birth date with the testing date. The syntax
also incorporated commands to properly round days and months per WJ-R scoring rules.

For CDS-III, we opted to use the Batch Score Utility (version 1.3), developed by the WoodcockMunoz Foundation, to perform an automated lookup of the WJ-R standardized test scores.

Briefly, the scoring process is as follows. The WJ-R scoring algorithm is dependent upon
referencing the specific version of the testing form that was used for each child, which for CDSIII was exclusively the English version of Form B. Then the raw score for each subtest could be
matched to an intermediate number known as the W Score – this intermediate step allows
standardization across the different forms of the WJ-R. The W Score is then compared against the
Reference W Score, which is the average W Score for a child of that particular age. The
Reference W has to be compared to the child's W Score to determine the difference and whether
that difference is positive or negative. From this value, the standardized score is located in a
reference table and this information is then transferred back to the main data file.

**WISC Digit Span Test for Short Term Memory**


The WISC Digit Span Test for Short Term Memory [8 ] is a test of the ability to process information
as it directly measures auditory short-term working memory. Digit span is the measure of how
many sequential digits can be taken in, stored, processed, and recalled in the correct order. In
CDS-III, the interviewer read a series of digits and the respondents then repeated the series. The
series began with two digits and kept increasing in length, with the final item having eight digits.
For each length, there were two trials. The test was repeated with a different set of digit series but
the second time, the respondent repeated the numbers backwards.

_**Administration Procedures**_

Interviewers were given the following instructions:


(1) Read each digit span only once at an even rate of one digit per second.
(2) Read Part A of a question; pause for response; then score.
(3) Read Part B of a question; pause for response; then score.
(4) If child does not respond after reading the question, do not encourage further.
(5) Stop when child misses Part A and Part B of any one question.
(6) To be scored as “correct”, no digits may be omitted or be in reversed order.
(7) READ TO CHILD: I can only read these instructions to you one time. I cannot repeat
them. I am going to say some numbers. Listen carefully, and when I am through, say them right
after me.

SAY: “Ready” BEFORE EACH QUESTION.

_**Scoring**_

Items were scored by summing the number of sequences answered correctly. The data files
include a digit-forward, digit-backward, and total score.

## Chapter 9 – Time Diaries

The time diaries are one of the unique features of the CDS design and provide data of central
importance to scientists in many disciplines. While the primary caregiver (PCG) and Child
interviews include stylized questions about the children’s structured and unstructured activities
and activities with parents and absent parents, the time diaries provide detailed accounting of the
type, number, duration, and location of activities during sampled 24-hour days, beginning at
midnight for one randomly sampled weekday and one randomly sampled weekend day. The time
diaries additionally collect information on the social context of the activity by specifying with
whom the child was doing the activity and who else was present but not engaging.

Response rate for the time diaries was 86% in 2007/2008 (88% in 2002/2003). The PCG
completed the diary for the young children but older child and adolescents were expected to
complete the time diaries themselves or with the assistance of the PCG, as needed.

With child-based weights, the time diaries give a representative national sample of children’s
activities and can also be converted into traditional time use aggregates, which are known to
provide less biased estimates of time amounts than do self-reports of time in particular activities
(Juster, Ono, and Stafford, 2003 [9] ). By nature of the CDS design, the rich time diary data can be
used with the detailed information in the other CDS modules as a way to examine influences on
key developmental outcomes and achievement patterns and can also be used with PSID data to
parcel out the ways in which family characteristics tie into children’s activity choices and
developmental outcomes.

The data collection methods, coding, general data files, time diary activity-level files, and time
diary aggregate files have not changed since CDS-II but are summarized in Table 9.1.

**Data Collection**


We invited CDS children and youth to complete a set of time diaries as part of their involvement
in the overall CDS data collection effort. Each participating child completed two time diaries, a
weekday (Monday-Friday) and weekend day (Saturday or Sunday). These days were randomly
selected when the interviewer completed the initial contact for the household. There was no
substitution of diary days once they were assigned to the CDS child/youth.

In all three waves, the CDS time diary was a paper diary that was mailed ahead before the
scheduled interview, with instructions to complete prior to the interview. During the in-house
CDS interview or by telephone, the interviewer reviewed and edited the diary with the child and
primary caregiver or, in the situations whereby the diary was not completed in advance, the
interviewer administered the diary as an interview.

**Coding**


We utilized the same interviewing procedures and coding protocols for the time use module in all
three waves of the CDS. With the increase in technology in the intervening years between CDS-II
and CDS-III, some activity codes were added to the "computer-related activities" grouping to
capture more detail in the use of cell phones for playign games, downloading movies/music,
reading email, social networking, reading media, and searching for information. Codes were also
added to the “organizational activities” group to differentiate activities occuring at school or
elsewhere. Refer to Appendix A of the CDS 2007 Time Diary Coding Manual for details on
these changes.

The activity codes utilized in CDS-III are easily mapped back to the prior waves. CDS-II created
a four-digit activity code whereby the first three digits reflect the 1997 code. If the code was
expanded to capture more specific detail, a sequential number beginning with “2” was added as
the fourth digit. The fourth (last) digit is a “0” for any code that remained identical to CDS-I
code, or in the case of an expanded code category for CDS-II, a “0” in the fourth digit indicates a
catch-all / unspecified code for that particular activity. The activity codebook (CDS 2007 Time
Diary Coding Manual) can be found at:


[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/Codebooks/2007codebook.pdf](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/Codebooks/2007codebook.pdf)

To help illustrate the point, here is an example. In CDS-I, we coded “homework” as one type of
activity. In CDS-II, we expanded the homework category to capture a distinction among noncomputer related homework, studying time, library time, and homework review with the parents
or caregivers. In the CDSII activity codebook the specific homework codes 5491-5494 are
indented under 5490, which visually identifies that they are new codes to 2002, with 5490 as a
general “catch all” code that was used in 1997. An excerpt from the codebook is on the next page:


CDS-III User Guide Page 41


Table 9.2 Example: Homework Codes in CDS-III Time Diaries

|Code|Code Description|
|---|---|
|5490.|General category for homework/studying-specific activity NA.|
|5491.<br> <br> <br> <br>|Homework, non-computer related.<br>Note. Homework using computer, code as 5040.|

**Data Files**


The CDS time diary data files are posted on the PSID-CDS Data Center
(http://simba.isr.umich.edu/), freely accessible to researchers worldwide who are interested in
using the data. The data are available at the activity level for CDS-III (57,813 records), with the
activities also grouped into broader or “aggregated” variables at the child level. The illustration
below shows you where you first need to go to access the time diary data – either the activity
level (select “Time Diaries”) or aggregate level (select “CDS incl. Time Diary Aggregates”):


CDS-III User Guide Page 42


_**Time Diary Activity-Level Files**_

The Time Diary Activity data file is structured at the activity level, meaning one data record per
activity per diary per child. There are three important identifiers in this file: (1) the ID68
(ER30001)-PN (ER30002) combination to identify the child for whom the activity belongs, (2)
the “Diary_07” variable to identify if the activity belongs to a weekday or a weekend diary (we
reviewed earlier that each child had up to two diaries taken – one for a randomly selected
weekday and one for a randomly selected weekend day; note that “T1_07” specifies the actual
day of the week), and (3) the start time of the activity, variable “COLB_07”. Start- and end-times
are represented in seconds past midnight. The duration of the activities are recorded as amount of
time in seconds that the activity took place.

The other variables in the data file are few in number - each one representing a column in the
time diary grid.. Since Columns H and I are “select all that apply” questions in the diary, there is
a variable for each possible option:

|Participating<br>(Column H in Time Grid)|There, but Not Participating<br>(Column I in Time Grid)|
|---|---|
|COLHA_07: NO ONE ELSE<br>COLHB_07: MOTHER<br>COLHC_07: FATHER<br>COLHD_07: SIBLING<br>COLHE_07: STEP-MOTHER<br>COLHF_07: STEP-FATHER<br>COLHG_07: STEP-SIBLING<br>COLHH_07: CHILD FRIEND<br>COLHI_07: GRANDPARENT<br>COLHJ_07: OTHER RELATIVE<br>COLHK_07: OTHER NON-<br>RELATIVE<br>|COLIA_07: NO ONE ELSE<br>COLIB_07: MOTHER<br>COLIC_07: FATHER<br>COLID_07: SIBLING<br>COLIE_07: STEP-MOTHER<br>COLIF_07: STEP-FATHER<br>COLIG_07: STEPSIBLING<br>COLIH_07: CHILD'S FRIEND<br>COLII_07: GRANDPARENT<br>COLIJ_07: OTHER RELATIVE<br>COLIK_07: OTHER NON<br>RELATIVE|



You can print out just a codebook of the file through the Data Center. To do this, simply select
the variables through the Data Center, but at the very last step, select “codebook only”. Since the
activity codes for columns A and J are so extensive, they are provided in a separate document
(CDS 2007 Time Diary Coding Manual):
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/Codebooks/2007codebook.pdf](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/Codebooks/2007codebook.pdf)

To give a better understanding of how the time diary activity file is structured, take a look at the
example data records below. The first 37 rows are activities that span two diaries T1_07 = 1
(Sunday) and T1_07 = 2 (Monday) for child “0004”-“039”. COLA_07 specifies the activity and
COLB_07 and COLC_07 specify the start- and end-time of the activity, respectively. There are
17 activity records for the Sunday diary for this particular child and 20 activity records for the
Monday diary. The first data record, for example, shows that the child was talking on the phone
(activity code 9610) from midnight (start-time in seconds past midnight = 0) to 2:00 AM (endtime in seconds past midnight = 7200 seconds); the child was using their cell phone so the
variable COLD_07 is coded accordingly (7=cell phone); and the child was at home during this


CDS-III User Guide Page 43


activity (COLG_07 = 10). The second data record shows that the child was sleeping (activity
code 4590) from 2:00 AM (start-time in seconds past midnight = 7200) to 2:24 PM (end-time in
seconds past midnight = 51840 seconds); the child was not watching television so COLD_07 is
coded as INAP (0); and the child was at home during this activity (COLG_07 = 10). Since the
child was not accessing the internet during either of these activities, COLF_07 is coded as INAP
(0). There are more variables in the data file, but this illustration should get you on the way to
understanding the file structure of the Activity file.

_**Time Diary Aggregate Files**_

In addition to the activity-level files, there are child-level time diary files which “roll-up”
individual activities in several ways: at the four-and three-digit code levels, which take all of the
time spent in each of the activities and sum them across the diary day, and at the two-digit level,
which aggregate time per diary day by 39 activity categories. These aggregate files are posted at
the child-level, facilitating their use with developmental data from the other CDS modules,
including (but not limited to) achievement measures, physical and emotional health assessments,
and family environment measures, or with PSID family economic and demographic data.


In the aggregate file, there is one record per child and a variable that will tell you if that child has
weekday diary data and another variable that will tell you if the child has weekend diary data. The
labeling convention is, as follows:


Variables that begin with “WD” indicate that it is a “weekday” activity; variables that begin with
“WE” indicate that it is a “weekend” activity. For CDS-III, the next two components of the
variable name is “07”, meaning, data collection start year 2007.


As mentioned above, there are four-digit aggregate variables, three-digit aggregate variables, and
two-digit aggregate variables. You can ascertain the level of the aggregation by the naming
convention. For the variables that roll up the activities at the four-digit level, the next four
components of the variable name are the four-digit code for the activity. For the variables that roll
up the activities at the three-digit level, the next four components of the variable name are an
underscore (“_”) and the three-digit equivalent (or, CDS-I equivalent) for the activity. For the
variables that roll up the activities at the two-digit level, the next four components of the variable
name are “39nn”, representing 39 categories and the two-digit code for the activity.


For example, let’s take a look at our previous example about homework time.


The four-digit aggregate variables for homework on weekdays are: WD074590, WD074591,
WD074592, WD074593, and WD074594.


The three-digit aggregate is the sum of all of the specialized homework codes and for weekday, is
represented as “WD07_549”: WD07_549 is equal to SUM (of WD075490, WD075491,
WD075492, WD075493, WD075494).


The two-digit aggregate that includes homework time is “EDUCATIONAL AND
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING”, code WD073913.


As in the Time Diary Activity-Level file, the duration of the activities are given in seconds.

## Chapter 10 – CDS-III School Environment Data * Note: These data will be released in winter 2010

Information about the schools attended by children in the CDS is gathered via report from both
the primary caregiver and child, and well as through links to administrative databases. As
described earlier, primary caregivers report on the target child’s current school enrollment, type
of school (public or private; home-schooled), tuition and other school-related costs; grade in
school, age began kindergarten, program enrollment for gifted youth or for special education, and
if child ever repeated a grade or ever dropped out of school. They additionally report on their
involvement in their children’s schools and own family processes that encourage academic
interests and achievements.

School characteristic data collected by the U.S. Department of Education National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Private School Universe
Survey (PSS) will be made available under restricted contract for CDS-III, as has been done for
CDS-I and CDS-II.

The CCD is a national database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school
districts in the United States. Data are available on the U.S. Department of Education’s website.
The CCD survey annually collects data about all public elementary and secondary schools, all
local education agencies, and all state education agencies throughout the United States. The CCD
contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on schools and school
districts; data on students and staff; and fiscal data. PSID makes available under sensitive data
contract an “ID Map” allowing users to extract CCD and PSS information specifically for the
CDS sample. This map provides the CDS-Identifiers along with the NCES CCD and PSS school
and school district identifiers for the school that the CDS child or youth attended during the CDSI, CDS-II, and CDS-III interviews. The PSS gathers information including: religious orientation;
level of school; size of school; length of school year, length of school day; total enrollment (K12); number of high school graduates, whether a school is single-sexed or coeducational and
enrollment by sex; number of teachers employed; program emphasis; and existence and type of
kindergarten program. This information is collected through administrative personnel in each of
the private schools. More details on each of the programs can be found here:

## Chapter 11 - Coded Variables in the PCG and Child Interviews

Coding was performed by staff at the Institute for Social Research’s Survey Research Operations
(SRO) group. Double-coding (i.e., “check-coding”) occurred for 10 percent of the cases, once by
the coder and a second time, by the SRO Production Manager assigned to the project, in order to
evaluate and verify a coder’s work on an item-by-item basis.

**Occupation & Industry for Youth’s Jobs**

The U. S. Census’ 2000 Occupation & Industry Code Lists (U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic
Surveys Division), consisting of approximately 980 occupation and 980 industry codes, were
used to classify responses to several job related open-ended questions in the Child interview:


Q33J6. Think about the job in which you work the most hours. What is your
occupation? What kind of work do you do on this job? What are your most
important activities or duties?


Q33J7. What kind of business or industry is that in? What do they make or do at this
workplace?


Q33J20. Think about the job in which you work the most hours. What was your
occupation? What kind of work did you do? What are your most important
activities or duties?


Q33J21. What kind of business or industry is that in? What do they make or do at this
workplace?


Q33J31A1-3. What are the three kinds of jobs you would like to have when you are
done with school?


Q33J31B. Which job do you want most?


Q33J32B. We can’t always get the jobs we want. Which job do you think you will
actually get to do?

**Code Frames for Open-Ended Questions**


When developing the framework for coding open-ended responses, the goal was to avoid
subjective judgments as much as possible and link coding to objective decision rules. To this end,
open-ended responses were first sorted into obvious groupings based on just the phrases or words
that the respondent used. All mentions, not just the most common ones, were included, and
counts assigned. This constituted the universe of items to be coded.

“Lowest common denominator” categories were then grouped (if possible) into larger
categories. Internet searches and background research often provided guidance in this step. If a
lowest common denominator category was substantially large, it was given its own category.
These “lowest common denominator” categories allowed obvious groupings to be spotted, while
at the same time implicating other potential groupings that could be developed after some


CDS-III User Guide Page 48


investigation. Every effort was made to maintain similar code frames for similar questions, such
as codes 30-97 for questions about family activities, hobbies, lessons, sports, and community
programs in which the child may be involved.

**Child Interview**

At the beginning of Section J, for the CDS youth aged 12 years and older, we asked about
racial/ethnic identity (Q33J1) and religious affiliation (Q33J2). Questions were formatted as
open-ended items whereby the youth reported on these identifications in their own words.

In the work items in the Child Interview, we ask if the youth plan to continue their
current/summer jobs into the future as well as the reasons why (Q33J15A1-3, Q33J29A1-3). For
those planning to go to college, we ask what they plan to major in (Q33J33N). In the ACASI
section, we ask the reason they are saving money (Q33L3E1-3).

**PCG Child Interview**

In Section A, we asked the PCG about the target child’s reasons for visits to the hospital
(Q31A3B1-3) and to the doctor – either for illness (Q31A5B1-3) or for injury (Q31A6B1-3). The
open-ended text was categorized by what the respondent said; that is, we did not attempt to roll
the data into any type of classification scheme.

In Section B, we asked the PCG several open-ended questions about his/her child’s current
education and expectations for future education. We categorized the data based on the responses
themselves.

Q31B3. What things might keep this child from getting as much education
as (he/she) wants? (This item is also in the Other Caregiver
Interview)

Q31B17b. Please specify the reason why (CHILD) is currently in a special
education class or program.

In Sections E, G, and H, we asked several open-ended questions about family activities, hobbies,
and extra curricular activities that were then categorized into groupings based on the data:

Q31E15a. In what family activities is (CHILD) included?

Q31H2a.  What are (CHILD)’s hobbies?

Q31H5b.  [Was (CHILD) in a tutoring program in the last 12 months?] What was the
tutoring for?
Q31H6a.  [Did (CHILD) take lessons, such as music, dance, or drama in the last 12
months?] Which lessons was (CHILD) involved in?


Q31H7a.  During the last school year which athletic or sports teams was (CHILD)
involved in?


Q31H7c.  Which school athletic or sports teams is (CHILD) involved in during this


CDS-III User Guide Page 49


school year?

Q31H7e.  Which organized sports programs was (CHILD) involved in during last
summer?


Q31H8a. Which community groups or programs was (CHILD) involved in?


Q31H9d. Which religious activities was (CHILD) involved in?


Additionally, we asked an open-ended question about other methods of dealing with a
poor report card to follow-up the closed-ended questions in Q31H16A-I.

Q31H16J1. [Are there any other things you do if (CHILD) brought home a report
card with grades or progress lower than expected?] What other things?

## Chapter 12 – PSID Data Resources

As described in the first chapter, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal
survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning
almost four decades of data collection, contains nearly 50,000 variables on a diverse set of topics,
including the dynamics of family composition change, marital and birth histories, housing,
income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of family members, expenditures,
philanthropy, and more. Nearly 70,000 people have ever participated in the panel, which includes
up to four generations within a family. The PSID is the longest running panel on family and
individual (including child) dynamics and has consistently achieved response rates of 96-98
percent. More information about the study and its instruments can be obtained from its website:
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/Overview.html. The PSID bibliography provides references
to studies using the data for many research topics (key word index provided):
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/.


As a CDS data user, the rich family data resource in the main PSID provides an incredible
opportunity to explore family environmental factors in your analyses of child outcomes. In this
chapter, our goal is to provide you with some basic (although not comprehensive) information
about the PSID sample, interview content, public and sensitive data contract file, and data
structure. Let’s start first with an overview of the sample origins and design.


**The PSID Sample**


The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from two independent samples: a nationally
representative sample of roughly 3,000 households designed by the Survey Research Center at the
University of Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and an over-sample of roughly 2,000 low income
families from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO sample”). From 1968 to 1996, the
PSID interviewed and re-interviewed individuals from families in these two samples every year,
whether or not they were living in the same dwelling or with the same people. Since 1997,
interviewing has taken place every other year. Also in 1997, the PSID added an immigrant
refresher sample that was intended to bring the sample up to representativeness of immigration
into the U.S. since 1968.


The PSID follows adults through the full life course. Children born to an original-sample member
are classified as sample members and are eligible for tracking as separate family units when they
set up their own households. Adult sample members who move out of the PSID family units are
tracked to their new family units. This procedure replicates the population’s family-building
activity and produces a dynamic sample of families each year. New PSID families form when
children grow up and establish separate households. The unique self-replacing design implies
that for many PSID families, the data include self-reported information on three (and occasionally
now, four) generations within the same family at various points in their life course. Through

**PSID Content**

As touched on above, the PSID contains a large number of variables that have been measured
wave after wave in much the same, if not the identical, manner. The table below gives a general
idea of the data collected but is by no means comprehensive. Years are provided when data were
collected for only some, but not all 36 waves of the PSID. Keep in mind that this table is by no
means exhaustive of the PSID content. Please see http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu documentation

**Family and Individual Level Variables in the PSID**

PSID variables can be categorized as family-level and individual-level. Most of the information
from any year’s data collection is categorized as **family-level variables** . The family-level
variables include not only information that applies to the family unit as a whole, but also almost
all information about the head and wife/ “wife”. **Individual-level variables** are wave specific
data as well as time invariant information that may span many years. These variables cover basic
demographic and economic data about an individual in the FU. If the individual was head or wife
/ “wife”, much of the information in these variables is available among the family level variables,
often in substantially greater detail.

**The Building Blocks to Using PSID Data on Families & Individuals**

Because of the complexity of the PSID data structure, and its long-panel nature, there are a few
PSID concepts that are important to understand to effectively take advantage of the richness of
the data archive. This section of the chapter attempts to give you some background on these
concepts.

Let’s first review the PSID definition of “family”. The **Family Unit (FU)** is defined as a group of
people living together as a family. “As a family” means to us that the individuals are generally
related by blood, marriage, or adoption, but unrelated persons can be part of a FU if they are
permanently living together and share both income and expenses. The **Household Unit (HU)**, on
the other hand, is defined as the physical boundary, such as a house or apartment, where members
of the PSID FU reside. Not everyone living in a HU is automatically part of the FU. The PSID
survey is about FU Members only.

Families change from year to year. Each family unit in a specific data collection wave is assigned
a unique **Family ID**, sometimes called “ **Interview Number** ”. The most critical Family ID is the
one assigned in 1968 to families in the original sample. According to our following rules, we
follow “split offs” as children and others as they set up their households. One family in 1968 can
become 3-4 or more families by 2007. All of these families will have the same 1968 ID, since
they originated from the same family in 1968, but will have different family ID’s in 2007, since
they are separate family units in 2007.

For each family, the Family ID number will most certainly vary from year to year. For example, a
1968 family ID of 1234 will not likely be 1234 in 1969 or any other year for that matter. Yearly
IDs are assigned based on receipt of the interview—the first interview in from field is numbered
1, the second, 2, and so on. In the table on the next page, the “Smith Family” in 1968 had a


CDS-III User Guide Page 55


Family ID of “0100” and included five FU members: Jason and Andrea, and their three children
Julie, Anne, and Todd:

|The “Smiths” in 1968 Family Unit Member|Age|1968 Family ID|
|---|---|---|
|~~Family Unit Member~~<br>|~~Age~~<br>|~~1968 Family ID~~<br>|
|~~Dad (Jason)~~<br>|~~36~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|
|~~Mom (Andrea)~~<br>|~~35~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|
|~~Julie~~<br>|~~12~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|
|~~Anne~~<br>|~~10~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|
|~~Todd~~<br>|~~8~~|~~0100~~|



By 2007, Jason and Andrea’s children had moved out on their own, thus creating four families
out of this original 1968 “Smith Family”. Notice each family keep their original 1968 ID, but also
was assigned unique 2007 Family ID:

|The “Smiths” in 2007 Families|68 ID|2007 Family ID|
|---|---|---|
|~~Families~~<br>|~~68 ID~~<br>|~~2007 Family ID~~<br>“Interview Number”<br>|
|~~Jason (Dad) & Andrea (Mom)~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|~~0834~~<br>|
|~~Julie, her husband and son~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|~~1004~~<br>|
|~~Anne~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|~~0971~~<br>|
|~~Todd, his wife and daughter~~<br>|~~0100~~|~~2202~~|



The PSID collects information about the **individuals** of each FU. In the Data Center, each
individual is uniquely identified by their combined **1968 ID** (labeled as ER30001 in the Data
Center) and **Person Number** (labeled as ER30002). At the time of data release for each wave of
the PSID, updates to Person Numbers are made. This is important to remember since it will
require updating of data files downloaded at a previous point-in-time.

The most information is collected about the Head of the household, the second most about the
wife (or “wife” in the scenario of a cohabiter for one year or more), and the least amount of detail
is collected about other family unit members (OFUMs), who are oftentimes the children in the
FU, but can also be boy/girlfriends, grandparents, etc. All of the individuals in an FU have a
**Relationship to the Head** coded in the data files.

.
As mentioned above, PSID gathers the most information about the **Head** of the FU. Within each
wave of data, each FU has only one current Head. The person designated as Head may change
over time as a result of other changes affecting the family. When a new Head must be chosen, the
following rules apply:

The Head of the FU must be at least 16 years old and the person with the most financial
responsibility for the FU. If this person is female and she has a husband in the FU, then he is
designated as Head. If she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least one year,
then he is Head. However, if the husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the
functions of Head, then the FU will have a female Head .

A new Head is selected in situations such as:


� Last year’s Head moved out of the HU (household unit), died or became incapacitated; or


CDS-III User Guide Page 56


� A female Head has gotten married; or


� An individual or group of individuals split-off to form a new FU (we’ll talk more about this

later).

The **Wife** is the spouse of the head; **“Wife”** is the cohabiter of one year or more. Much of the
information collected in the PSID about Heads is also collected about the Wives and “Wives”.

Continuing with our Smith Family example, Julie was one of the original sample members in
1968. She was the daughter of Jason (Head) back then. In 2007, she was living in her own FU,
Family ID 1004, with her husband and their child. Her relationship to Head is now Wife. Her
husband is Head and their son is Child of Head.

Julie’s Family in 2007

|2007 Family ID|68 ID|Individuals|Relationship to Head|
|---|---|---|---|
|~~1004~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|~~Julie (original 1968~~<br>sample member)<br>|~~20 (Wife to Head)~~<br>|
|~~1004~~<br>|~~0100~~<br>|~~Husband~~<br>|~~10 (Head)~~<br>|
|~~1004~~<br>|~~0100~~|~~Son~~|~~30 (Child of Head)~~|



**Other Family Unit Members (OFUMs)** are the other individuals living in the family unit. Not
as much information is collected about OFUMs as Heads and Wives. Generally, the PSID main
interview provides individual level data on the OFUMs as well as data each wave about their:


� Demographic information, such as birth month and year, sex, date of death, family unit
status, wave-specific response status


� Marital and fertility histories, and cohabitation status


� Work status, number of jobs, occupation, weeks worked on job, during which months of
previous year (2006), hours per week


� Other income sources – (interest, TANF, SSI, welfare, social security, unemployment
compensation, worker’s compensation, child support, help from relatives)


� (For OFUMs 16 years and older) highest grade or year of school completed


� (For OFUMs 16-49 years of age) Date last attended school and whether currently
enrolled as part time or full time student


� Health insurance coverage


Note that CDS “children” are OFUMs in the PSID data collections and are considered PSID

individuals. Data about them in the main PSID interviews can be merged onto CDS data files.

In CDS, the **primary and secondary caregivers are in relationship to the child** (variables
“RELPCG07” and RELOCG07” in 2007). If you are interested in merging data from PSID about
the caregivers, it is helpful to know the caregivers’ relationships to head. In some situations, the
data you are interested in may have only been collected for Heads and Wives. This accounts for


CDS-III User Guide Page 57


the majority of the PCG and OCGs.

Keeping in mind the PCG’s Relationship to Head, if you are interested in constructing, for
example, the PCG average work hours, you will find that PSID asks for this information and
stores it in three separate variables depending on the individual’s relationship to head:

ER36170 BC43 On average, how many hours a week did you work on this job in
2006?--CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (HEAD)


ER36428 DE43. On average, how many hours a week did she work on this job in
2006?--CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (WIFE)


At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned that the PSID has a self-replacing sample design
whereby children are interviewed as their own family unit after they leave their parents’
households and other adult sample members who move out of the family unit are tracked to their
new family units. With this design, at any wave, the PSID has main or “re-interview” families
and split-off families. A **main or reinterview family** is a family unit (FU) that was interviewed
in the prior wave. In the case of children leaving home, the main family is almost always the
parental family. A **split-off family**, on the other hand, consists of a person or group of people (at
least one of whom is a “followable” person of any age) who moved out from a main family since
the prior wave’s interview to form a new, economically independent family unit. Several criteria
must be met for a split-off to occur. In addition to having moved out since the prior wave and to
being ‘followable’ (i.e., having an original 1968 family identification), the person or group of
people have not moved to an institution such as college or prison or to another family unit within
the panel study. Moreover, the person or group of people who have moved out and formed their
own family unit must be economically independent (i.e., they must be paying their own living
expenses) from the family unit from which they split off. Information that informs the criteria is
gathered at the main family interview, during the household listing stage. The main family
Respondent provides these details. It should be noted that these are general rules and that
sometimes unique situations arise that determine whether a person or group of persons becomes a
split-off. For example, while moving to an institution, such as college, does not generally meet
the criteria for becoming a split-off, if the person is working, paying their own living expenses,
and paying their own educational expenses in addition to attending school, then this person would
be considered a split-off. Information that can inform this type of scenario is gathered in Section
G of the main family interview and in the interviewer observations. The living situation and
interview data for each and every possible split-off case are first reviewed before split-off status
is granted.

**Family Composition Change**

When looking at variables pertinent to the same person(s) over time, the variable called
“Sequence Number” can be of help in understanding continuity and change in family composition
wave-to-wave. The **Sequence Number**, found in the individual file, identifies an individual’s
status with regard to the family unit at a given wave of data collection. The sequence number is
coded as follows:

1-20 indicates that the individuals were in the family at the time of the current wave interview


51-59 indicates that the individuals were in institutions at the time of the current wave interview


71-80 indicates that the individuals moved out of the FU or out of institutions and established


CDS-III User Guide Page 58


their own households between the prior and current wave interview


81-89 indicates that the individuals died by the current interview but were living at the time of
the prior wave interview.

PSID also has a variable (“ **Whether Moved In/Out** ”) to indicate whether the individual moved
in or out of a family unit in a given wave of data. The 2007 codebook definition below helps
illustrate the detail of this variable.

|1|Moved in or born between the 2005 and 2007 interviews; split-off in 2007|
|---|---|
|2<br>|~~Appeared; moved in by the time the 2005 interview was taken but not included in FU for~~<br>2005 (i.e. listing error)<br>|
|5<br>|~~Moved out of FU or out of an institution between the 2005 and 2007 interviews and was~~<br>not included in a 2007 panel FU<br>|
|~~6~~<br>|Moved out of FU and into an institution between the 2005 and 2007 interviews<br>|
|~~7 ~~<br>|Living in 2005 but died by the time of the 2007 interview<br>|
|8 <br>|~~Disappeared; moved out prior to the 2005 interview, but included in FU for 2005 (usually a~~<br>listing error)|



**PSID Data Center Files**

Most of the family and individual-level data on all waves of the PSID and CDS are housed in the
online Data Center. There are tutorials that provide a guided overview to utilizing the data. You
can create customized data sets and codebooks through the easy-to-use Data Center. More
information on using the Data Center is provided in Chapter 14.

_**Data Groupings**_

In the Data Center, you will find the data grouped by PSID main study data and CDS data.
Within the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family level files.
The individual level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data, mentioned earlier in
this chapter. The family-level files include not only “raw” interview data but also complex
generated variables on income, work, wealth, sample weights, and other measures. Data, by wave
of the study, are provided as the next level within each of the data groupings. In the CDS data
group, the data are clustered by child-level files, which include all of the interview modules, and
by time diary activity files, which are at the activity level.


CDS-III User Guide Page 59


CDS-III User Guide Page 60


## Chapter 13 – Data File Structure within CDS Files

CDS-III data are stored in 11 groupings, each file specific to a CDS-III data collection module
described in Chapter 2 of this User Guide, with the addition of a background data file labeled
“Demographic File”. Except for Time Diary Activity file, the data are stored as one record per
child. Time Diary Activity data are stored as one record per time use activity (each child can have
more than one activity record). Once you are in the Data Center and have selected the “CDS”
grouping, you will see all of the possible data files listed, with a selection box for each wave in
which the data are available. (http://simba.isr.umich.edu/ALL/selectcats.asp). The table in
Appendix D provides an overview of the 11 CDS data groupings.

The PCG Household and OCG Household data were collected at the family level, meaning if two
children in the same household were interviewed for CDS-III, the household interview was
administered only once to the PCG and once to the OCG (if applicable). The household-level
PCG values in CDS-III were not duplicated as had been done in the earlier waves. This allows
users to analyze the household file without first having to filter out the duplicates.

When linking the CDS-III PCG-Household data to the corresponding Child data, you first should
subset the PCG-HH file to only include one record for each household using the Interview
Number (ER33901). Since this file is originally at the child-level, there are some duplicates; you
will have to exclude the records which have zeroes for the non-selected child record. It will then
be necessary to merge that subset with the Child file using the Interview Number. There are
some PCG IWs which do not have a corresponding Child IW completed at wave-III, and some
Child IWs which do not have a corresponding PCG IW completed at this wave. Table 13.1 in the
User Guide describes this situation. The sibling indicator in the CDS-III Demographic File gives
you information on whether a specific CDS response child has a response sibling in the CDS-III.
Note that Family ID accompanies data downloads.

Completion of a Child Interview by either the Child or PCG was required for the CDS case to be
considered “response” in the CDS-III data collection. The other interview modules were
completed based on eligibility and cooperation with appropriate respondent in the home or
school. The data files are structured to reflect this study design. Refer to Appendix D for details.

In the 2007 Demographic file, you will find a set of indicator variables for Assessment, Child,
Time Diary, and OCG modules that specify (a) if a case was eligible for that module and (b) if a
record exists for that case in the corresponding data file. These variables are helpful when you
merge variables from multiple CDS modules. The sample weights in the Demographic file, as
described in Chapter 4, can be used to adjust for unit nonresponse at the Child or PCG level. The
module indicator variables, however, will inform you about item missing data across modules. It
is up to you to then decide on your preferred approach for addressing item missing data that
results from differential response rates across modules (for example, you may leave it as missing,
impute data, etc).

To review, each response target child has a data record in the Child interview file, and each
response target PCG has a data record in the PCG interview files. You will not find a data record
in any of these modules that is not in either the Child data file or the PCG data file, because in
order to be considered a “response” one of the two interviews must have been completed. This is
unlike CDS-I and CDS-II and has been adapted for the aging CDS-III sample. For example, there
are 28 completed Time Diary interviews without a corresponding Child interview, because the
corresponding PCG interview was completed. Similarly, not every targeted child with a
completed Child interview necessarily has a completed interview for each (or any) of the other


CDS-III User Guide Page 61


modules. For CDS-III, though the definition of “response” was updated, we have still included
every completed PCG interview, regardless of the Child Interview completion. This was done in
order to give CDS data users the most complete set of data possible, and the sample weights have
taken this change into account. Table 13.1 provides a complete breakdown of all interview/noninterview combinations in CDS-III (these indicator variables are available in the Demographic
file).

Variable names were kept as similar as possible and variable labels the same or as similar as
possible in CDS-III as to CDS-II and CDS-I for convenience in referencing variables. Variable
labels in CDS-III have “07” at the end. For example, one of the behavior problem index items
Q31B30D is labeled “CURIOUS 07” in CDS-III, and its companion variable in CDS-I, Q1G24D,
is labeled “CURIOUS”, while its companion variable in CDS-II, Q21B30D, is labeled
"CURIOUS 02".

Variable names in CDS-III generally start with the “Q3x” (x=1–9) prefix. For example, variable
Q31A3-“HOSPITALIZATION 07” is from CDS 2007 PCG Child interview (indicated by “Q31”
in the variable name and “07” in the variable label), Question A3.

On the CDS website, we have posted an excel table that serves as a cross-wave index, mapping
the individual variables across the first two waves of the CDS. This file is located at:

[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/questionnaires/pcgchild_xyr.pdf.](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/questionnaires/pcgchild_xyr.pdf) We will be updating this
table for CDS-III shortly. You can also download codebooks from the Data Center or review online when selecting variables. Codebooks give exact question wording and complete code frame .

## Chapter 14 – Using the Data Center and Merging Files

With exception of sensitive data contract files, all PSID, TA, and CDS data are located on the
PSID-TA-CDS Data Center. In this chapter, we provide you with a basic step-by-step guide to
using the Data Center. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, there are also tutorials on the website
that are helpful to understanding basic structural concepts in the data (see
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data/DataCenterHilites.ppt](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data/DataCenterHilites.ppt) and
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/tutorials/tutorials_home.html). While all of the CDS data](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/)
are located within the Data Center, some PSID data are located in zipped files (see
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data). The codebook and read-me file that accompany each
supplemental data file are detailed enough to illustrate the data structure and content of the files.
Towards the end of this chapter, we give you some basic information on merging data across the
PSID, TA, and CDS.

In addition to actual data about the CDS child and his/her family, there are a number of tools on
the PSID-TA-CDS website that facilitate use of the data, such as the Caregiver Map and the
Family Identification Mapping System. This chapter gives an overview of how these tools
function. Let’s start with a few basic concepts of the Data Center.

**Using the Data Center: The Basics**

The underlying premise of the Data Center is to facilitate the selection of variables from the CDS,
TA, and the PSID panel, across multiple data collection years, and to output the data in a format
that fits your specific analytic needs. More specifically, there are six main functions within the
PSID-CDS Data Center that facilitate building a data file. These functions are: 1) automatic
downloading and merging of multiple waves of PSID data to create PSID-CDS datasets; 2)
customized codebooks in many formats; 3) subsetting option for certain types of individuals or
families; 4) intergenerational dataset creation for CDS children, TA young adults and PSID
family members; 5) data cart management; and 6) search and browse functions. The following
section will describe these functions as we show you how to create customized data sets and
codebooks using over 50,000 variables across the (current to this writing) 35 waves of PSID data
(1968-2007), two waves of TA data (2005 and 2007), and three waves of CDS data (1997, 2002,
and 2007).

_**Data Groups**_

The PSID-TA-CDS Data Center stores data for PSID, TA, and CDS-Into groupings of variables.
In the PSID, data groups are mainly categorized as individual level data (time-invariant grouping
and PSID individual grouping) and family level data, which includes data from the questionnaire
and data from constructed measures (e.g., Income Plus, Work Hours and Wages, etc.). In the TA
and CDS, data groups mainly follow data the collection modules. The structure of the CDS data
files is described in the previous chapter. Mainly, all files except for Time Diaries are child-level
files, with one data record per participating CDS child. When you select data from the CDS
grouping, you final output file should have up to 3,563 data records if you selected from CDS-I
grouping, 2,907 records if you selected from CDS-II data, or 1,506 if you selected from CDS-III
data.

If you select variables from both PSID and CDS data groupings, your data file is structured as one
record per CDS child, with PSID individual or family variables attached to each record.
Individual level data from PSID, in this scenario, is about the child, while the family level data
are about the family unit in which the child resided in that data collection year and the head or the


CDS-III User Guide Page 65


wife of the child’s family unit. Later in this chapter, we discuss merging on PSID individual data
about the child’s parents and caregivers.

_**Welcome to the Data Center!**_

When arriving at the Data Center’s homepage, you will see there are four ways to add variables to
your cart: 1) By File; 2) By Topical Index; 3) By Search; or 4) By Cart.


_**Selecting Variables by File**_

When adding by file, you will use the drill-down interface to eventually select specific variables
from PSID/CDS and add them to your data cart. You must first, however, select the Data
Group(s) of interest from PSID, TA, CDS, or any combination of the three. In our example, we
select the “PSID Family-level” data group and the “CDS” data group:


CDS-III User Guide Page 66


_**Wave of Data**_

Expanding these selections even further allows you to view the specific waves, or years, of data
that are available for each selected data group from both the PSID and CDS. You can build your
data file by selecting any number of waves of data from the PSID and CDS. PSID currently has
35 waves of data in the Data Center and CDS has three waves.


CDS-III User Guide Page 67


The next step is to then select data year(s) of interest from each data group. In our example on the
next page, we selected 2007 data from “PSID Main Family Data” and 2007 data from CDS
“Demographic File” and “Primary Caregiver Child File.”


CDS-III User Guide Page 68


_**Variable Selection**_

The third step to creating your PSID-CDS data file is to actually select the variables of interest
and add them to your data cart. You can select as few or as many from each of the data groupings
you have already chosen. In our example, we select “ER40876 – HEAD TOTAL HOURS OF
WORK- 2006” (the Head’s total work hours in the previous year (2006)) from the 2007 PSID
Family File. From the CDS 2007 Demographic File we select “RELPCG07” & “RELOCG07”
(the relationship of the PCG and OCG to the child), and “CH07WT,” (the child’s sample weight
in 2007 dependent on the completion of the Child Interview). NOTE: to select more than one
variable, press and hold Control. We also select all ten variables belonging to the Behavior
Problem Index (BPI), “Q31B29A” through “Q31B29J,” from the CDS 2007 Primary Caregiver
File. Once you have selected all desired variables by highlighting them, click the “Add To Cart”
button located at the top of the page.


CDS-III User Guide Page 69


_**Review of Data Selections**_

The next step is to review the selections you have chosen by viewing your data cart. Clicking the
blue “your cart” link will take you to a summary of the variables you have chosen. Clicking
“Expand All” will provide you with a detailed list of all selected variables, and allows you to
delete any that are unwanted.


CDS-III User Guide Page 70


Notice that the Data Center automatically appends certain key individual and family identifier
variables to the data set, such as “ER30001,” “ER33903,” and “ER33901.” These variables,
which are described in depth in Chapter 12, are important to understanding relationships within
the family and to the family head.

_**Output Options**_

After finalizing your variables, “Checkout” your data cart. In this step you can specify the type of
format for your codebook and data file outputs, and also name your file. In our example we select
a PDF codebook and a SAS data file, and name our file “Behavior Problems”.


CDS-III User Guide Page 71


Additionally, under “Cart Options,” you may elect to have the Data Center notify you via email
after your data have been created and provide you with a link to your output files. This option
allows saving data carts for future use.

You may also decide it is necessary to limit the sample to cases where one or more variables are
in specific value ranges to define a subset of observations. To subset the data, enter the
appropriate command in the “Subsetting Criteria” box in the Output Options section of the data
selection process.

If the email option is not elected, the Data Center will create the specified files and allow you to
view, download, and save them.


CDS-III User Guide Page 72


_**Selecting Variables by Topical Index**_
A second approach to selecting variables in the Data Center is by Topical Index. This method
also employs a drill-down tree interface that allows you to browse through the many topical
categories of variables and chose the desired waves of data available for those selected.


In this example, we will again attempt to select the Behavior Problem Index variables from the
2002 CDS. Expanding the “CDS Variables” data group leads us to the “Problem Behaviors”
category, which contains the Behavior Problem Index.


CDS-III User Guide Page 73


Expanding the “PCG Reported” BPI lists the 39 possible variables in this topic, and allows you to
directly select as many or as few of the variables for any combination of waves available. We can
see that CDS data for these variables are available for the 1997, 2002, and 2007 waves. NOTE: If
you are unsure about what wave you are selecting, float your mouse over the checkbox in
question to display the year. In our example, we select the following: “Cries too Much,”
“Demands attention,” & “Destructive” for 1997, and “Destructive” for 2002 and 2007. Once you
have selected all desired variables by checking the appropriate boxes, click the “Add to Cart”
button located at the top of the page.


As before, you may follow the blue “your cart” link and “Expand All” to get a detailed summary
of the contents in your data cart, including the variables you selected, and the key relational
identifier variables the Data Center appends automatically.


CDS-III User Guide Page 74


Lastly, “Checkout” your cart, select your output options, and retrieve your customized data files.


CDS-III User Guide Page 75


_**Selecting Variables by Search**_

A third approach to selecting variables is to use the Search feature, which allows you to search
codebook text for all variables in the Data Center. You may select any combination of Data File
Types and Data Years, as well as specify the text field types it searches against. You may search
against variable names, variable labels, question text & explanation text (notes about the question
wording or variable construction), or all of the above.

In our example, we look for the phrase “Behavior Prob” in the Question/Explanation text fields
for variables in the 1997 and 2002 CDS data group.


The engine generates a list of all records of the BPI index for 1997, 2002, and 2007, including
such variables as the internalizing and externalizing scale and total BPI score. Clicking “Check
All” and “Add To Cart” will deposit the variables into the Data Cart, which we can then review
and output into the desired format(s).

CDS-III User Guide Page 77


**Linking Data Files**


There are a large number of variables in the PSID that can be used along with CDS. Every
individual in the PSID has both an “ID68” (1968 Family Identifier) and “PN” (Person Number)
that when combined, uniquely identify that individual. Identifier variables are available through a
“CDS Caregiver Map” that is created automatically whenever CDS and/or PSID individual-level
data are downloaded as well as through the Family Identification Mapping System. Let’s start
with the Child-to-Caregiver Map file.

_**CDS Caregiver Map**_
An integral aspect of the CDS research design is to collect information about the children’s
caregivers. Typically, the caregivers are the children’s biological or adoptive parents but not
always. We define the primary caregiver as the person living with the child who has primary
responsibility for caring for that child and the secondary caregiver as the person living with the
child who assumes secondary responsibility for caring for that child. Under this definition, nonbiological parents may assume a central caregiver role in the child’s life.

Since the caregivers reside with the CDS child by study definition, information about them is
collected in the main PSID. To make linkages possible between the rich panel data in the PSID
data archive and the CDS, we provide a file with unique individual identifiers for the CDS child,
primary caregiver, and secondary caregiver that is automatically appended to any Data Center
download of CDS data. The map file always has the same name as the data download, with
“map” in the filename. For example, if your data file name is “job39350.txt”, your map data file
would be “map39350.txt”.

The file is formatted as a flat file, with one record per CDS-Individual. Every individual in the
PSID has both a 1968 Family Identifier or “ID68” and Person Number or “PN” that when
combined, uniquely identify that individual. In the Data Center, these variables are “ER30001 –
1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER” (ID68) and “ER30002 – PERSON NUMBER 68” (PN). The first
two columns of the map file are ER30001 and ER30002, which are the 1968 Family Identifier
and Person Number, respectively, of the child. The next two variables, PCGID97 and PCGPN97,
represent the ER30001 (1968 Family ID) and ER30002 (Person Number) of the individual
identified as the primary caregiver of the child in 1997. The next two variables OCGID97 and
OCGPN97, represent the ER30001 (1968 Family ID) and ER30002 (Person Number) of the
individual identified as the other caregiver of the child in 1997. Missing data points on the OCG
variables indicates that a secondary caregiver who is in the PSID followable sample was not
identified for that year.

The PCG and OCG variables are repeated in the next four columns, but here, represent the
identifiers for CDS-II (2002-2003) data collection. Note that missing data points on PCG 2002
identifiers indicate that the CDS child did not participate in the second wave. Missing data points
on the OCG 2002 identifiers indicate either (a) the CDS child did not participate in the second
wave, or (b) a secondary caregiver who is in the PSID followable sample was not identified for
that year. You can determine whether a secondary caregiver was in the home at the time of the
CDS-II interview with variable RELOCG02 on the CDS-II Demographic data file.

Similarly, the PCG and OCG variables are repeated again in the following four columns, but here,
represent the identifiers for CDS-III (2007) data collection. Note that missing data points on PCG
2007 identifiers indicate that the CDS child did not participate in the third wave. Again, missing
data points on the OCG 2007 identifiers indicate either (a) the CDS child did not participate in the


CDS-III User Guide Page 78


third wave, or (b) a secondary caregiver who is in the PSID followable sample was not identified
for that year. You can determine whether a secondary caregiver was in the home at the time of the
CDS-III interview with variable RELOCG07 on the CDS-III Demographic data file. Table 1 is an
example “map file” output.

Table 1: Excerpt from the CDS Caregiver Map File


In the example above, the primary caregiver for the first child listed, “0655”-“030” is “0655”“172” in both CDS-I and CDS-II. The secondary caregiver for child “0655”-“030” is “0655”“003” in both waves as well. There are two ways to determine the relationship of the caregivers to
the child. The first is to use the variables on the CDS Demographic data files “RELPCG97/02”
and “RELOCG97/02”. This information was reported by the PCG during the CDS data
collections. The second approach is to use the “Relationship to Head” variables on the PSID
individual files to map a relationship of the child to the caregiver through both of their
relationships to the person designated as the “Head” of the family.

To use the CDS caregiver map file for merging data about the caregivers onto CDS child-level
file, you need to create data files about each of the caregivers, merge onto the map file, then
merge onto the CDS child-level file. First, identify the variables about the PCG and the OCG that
are of relevance to your analysis. The cross-year index in the Data Center
(http://simba.isr.umich.edu/VS/i.aspx) is an excellent tool for selecting measures within specific
substantive domains across multiple waves of the PSID. Keep in mind that some characteristics
of the PCG and OCG may be in the PSID Individual File and some may be in the PSID Family
Files if these individuals are Heads (and Wives) of PSID families. Chapter 12 of the CDS-III
User Guide provides information on PSID respondent roles and data structure – this is a good
place to start to get acquainted with the PSID content prior to selecting data.

Once a data file about the PCG and a data file about the OCG are created, merge these files onto
your CDS map file by using ID68 and PN for each of the caregivers as the primary keys for
merging. The last step is to merge these files onto the CDS data file you have downloaded from
the PSID-CDS Data Center. Use ER30001 and ER30002 as the primary keys for merging. The
end result is a data file with all of the CDS variables that you have selected for your analyses and
the identifiers for the caregivers.


CDS-III User Guide Page 79


_**Family Identification Mapping**_

As mentioned earlier, caregivers are usually, but not always, biological or adoptive parents. There
may be times when you want to know about biological or adoptive parents only or grandparents.
In the fall of 2006, PSID incorporated a new data extraction tool on the PSID-CDS website
(http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/FIMS) called the “Family Identification Mapping System” or
“FIMS”. FIMS facilitates the process of constructing a data file with identifiers for pre-specified
relationships to PSID individuals. For example, by using the FIMS, you can easily create a
customized inter-generational identification map with identifiers for parents, grandparents, or
great grandparents.

This section describes how the FIMS constructs Inter-Generation Identification (GID) data files.
The FIMS uses the _Parent Identification File or “PID”_, a supplemental PSID data file that
summarizes information about parent-child relationships in its “behind-the-scenes” extraction
process. The PID contains relevant identifiers for the child and his or her birth and adoptive
parents for all individuals in the PSID (not just the CDS children), including both sample and
nonsample individuals. More information about the original construction of PID and its updating
process is available in the “Parent Identification Introduction” documentation (see URL:
http://simba.isr.umich.edu/Zips/ZipSupp.aspx#MH). A brief description of the file and how
individual family members are followed across time and generations in the PSID is available in
Chapter 12 of the CDS-III User Guide.

To illustrate the FIMS process for creating a GID data file, we will use an example for selecting
_biological parents and grandparents of the CDS children_ . The final output file will have one data
record per individual with biological parent and grandparent identifiers, where available, on each
record. Let’s get started.

**Step 1: Getting to FIMS**

The FIMS extraction tool is part of the data sharing resources on the PSID-CDS website. You can
access FIMS from http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/FIMS. To begin the process of constructing a
GID file with parent and grandparent identifiers of CDS sample members, select “Intergeneration (GID)” under “Select Map Type”, the first selection box on the FIMS home page.
Options for further specification will then appear.

**Step 2: Select Parent-Type**


Under “Parents” drop box, select “biological parents”.


CDS-III User Guide Page 80


FIMS uses in its “behind the scenes” extraction. While the FIMS draws upon the PID as the
initial source of information in creating GID data files, there are important differences between
what the PID and the FIMS offer. These differences are highlighted as we describe how the FIMS
tool works. The FIMS relies on PID variables that contain the 1968 Family Identifier (“interview
number”) and Person Number for all PSID individuals and their parents of interest (i.e., variables
PID1-2; PID3-4; PID5-6; PID17-18; PID1920). As described earlier, the combination of the 1968
Family Identifier and Person Number uniquely identify each individual in the PSID. Currently,
there are 83,663 individuals in the PID data file. Recall that there are 3,563 CDS-I participants
enrolled at the baseline interview in 1997.


The example in this document focuses on selecting _biological parents and grandparents of the_
_CDS children_ . The PID contains information about adoptive parents and likewise, in the FIMS,
you can specify adoptive parents for your output identification map file. For our example,
however, we are focusing on biological parents. Table 2, below, shows the PID input data for
biological parents upon which the FIMS would draw. The data are shown for PSID family
“2069” and are current as of the 2003 wave of the PSID. Data points with a value of “0” on the
PID represent a lack of available information about that individual or, in the case of adoptive
parents, the possibility that the individual does not have an adopted mother/father. From the table
below, we see that Family “2069” has 20 individual members. There are identification numbers
for biological mothers for 14 of the individuals and identification numbers for biological fathers
for nine of the individuals.


CDS-III User Guide Page 81


Table 2: Data Values from PID for PSID Family 2069


Next, FIMS selects information for all individuals in the PID who have ever been a part of a
PSID family unit. These are the individuals about whom PSID has collected data. Recall that the
purpose of FIMS is to facilitate the development of analytic files for exploring intergenerational
patterns on a wide range of topics measured in the PSID and CDS. If an individual never resided
in a PSID family and data were never collected about them, then we would not be able to include
them in analysis. Hence, they are not included in FIMS. They are, however, included on the PID.
We can identify these individuals by their Person Number: range of 900-990. From the PID
codebook, person numbers are defined as:


**PN Code** **Code Description**

1 - 19 Individuals living in core sample families at the time of the 1968 interview; individuals
living in Latino sample families at the time of the 1990 (or 1992) interview; individuals

170 - 226 Individuals who moved into a core family for the first time after the 1968 interview or
who have no sample parent; individuals from the Latino sample, other than the spouse of
a 1990 (or 1992) Head, who moved out in the year preceding the 1990 (or 1992)
interview or who moved in for the first time after the 1990 (or 1992) interview;
individuals from the
Immigrant sample, other than the spouse of a 1997 (or 1999) Head, who moved out in the
year preceding the 1997 (or 1999) interview or who moved in for the first time after the
1997 (or 1999) interview. These individuals are nonsample unless they were born after
the initial wave and have at least one sample parent.

227 Spouse of a core sample 1968 Head who moved out in the year prior to the 1968
interview; spouse of a Latino sample 1990 Head who moved out in the year preceding the
1990 (or 1992) interview; spouse of an Immigrant sample 1997 (or 1999) Head who
moved out in the year preceding the 1997 (or 1999) interview. These individuals are
nonsample.

228 Spouse of a core sample 1968 Head who died in the year prior to the 1968 interview;
spouse of a Latino sample 1990 (or 1992) Head in the year prior to the 1990 (or 1992)
interview; spouse of an Immigrant Latino sample 1997 (or 1999) Head in the year prior to
the 1997 (or 1999) interview. These individuals are nonsample.


229 - 399 Individuals who moved into a core family for the first time after the 1968 interview or
who have no sample parent; individuals from the Latino sample, other than the spouse of
a 1990 (or 1992) Head, who moved out in the year preceding the 1990 (or 1992)
interview or who moved in for the first time after the 1990 (or 1992) interview;
individuals from the
Immigrant sample, other than the spouse of a 1997 (or 1999) Head, who moved out in the
year preceding the 1997 (or 1999) interview or who moved in for the first time after the
1997 (or 1999) interview. These individuals are nonsample unless they were born after
the initial wave and have at least one sample parent. This series is simply a continuation
of the 170-226 group.

900-990 Child who has never been in any sample family.

The Person Number range of 1 to 399 (actual data range 1-231 for PID Release # 4) represents
individuals who have resided in family units and are thus included in FIMS. There are 78,902
individuals listed in the PID but 65,332 have a person number under 900 and are thus included in
FIMS.

When we select CDS-I baseline participant data records (n=3,563) from the PID, we find that all
CDS-Individuals have a person number in the range of 1-231 and are thus included in FIMS. In
terms of biological parents, there are four CDS children whose biological mothers have a PN
greater than 900 and have thus never resided in a PSID family and 64 CDS children for whom we
do not have data on biological mothers (PN=0). There are seven CDS children whose biological
fathers have a PN greater than 900 and 833 CDS children for whom we do not have data on
biological fathers (PN=0). The net result is that as of the 2003 PSID Data Release, there are
biological mother identifiers for 3,495 CDS-I baseline participants and biological father
identifiers for 2,723 CDS-I baseline participants in the FIMS.

To illustrate, Table 2 shows the individuals in the PID for Family 2069 who would be excluded
from FIMS since they never resided in a PSID family unit. These excluded individuals with a PN


CDS-III User Guide Page 83


greater or equal to 900 are represented below as “.”. There are three individuals, four biological
mothers, and five biological fathers. We would not expect to find these individuals in the FIMS
output nor would we expect to find the biological mothers and fathers who are coded as “0” in
PID.


**Step 3: Select Generation Map**


The next step is to select a map that will provide identifiers for CDS children, their biological
parents, and their biological grandparents. Under “Generation Map” drop box, select “Individual
to Grandparents”. In this scenario, “grandparent” is the farthest reaching generation. The output
file will provide identifiers for the individuals, their parents, and grandparents.


CDS-III User Guide Page 84


The process for identifying grandparents is similar to the process described above for identifying
parents. Essentially, FIMS iterates the extraction, this time focusing on _parents of parents_, or
grandparents. Because we have selected “Biological Only” under “Parents” drop box, our
example is focused on biological parents and grandparents.


To execute this request, FIMS looks at each individual in the PID and finds biological parents and
grandparents. Table 4 shows the generational linkage that FIMS would output for PSID Family
“2069”. Each individual from family “2069” is listed under “ID68.PN” – a combination variable
of ER30001 and ER30002. Take a look back at Table 3 to see the correspondence between the
input data and output data.


The next variable in Table 4 is the Generation Number. Note that some individuals in Family
“2069” are third generation individuals. The next column, “Ancestor to Individual Link Path”
shows the lineage. Looking back at individual “2069” “030”, we see the mother and grandmother
of individual 2069.030 are listed on the first line, and the parents (mother first, father second)
listed on the next two lines. For Family “2069”, there are eight individuals with identifiers for at
least one biological parent, and three individuals with identifiers for at least one biological
grandparent.


Table 4: Individual, GID and Generation Linkage and Parent Type in FIMS for Family
“2069”Out of the CDS-I baseline participants, there are 3,495 biological mothers, 2,723
biological fathers, and 3,043 biological grandparents with identifiers in the FIMS and data in the
PSID archive.

**Step 4: Select Generation Map Type and Format**


The last step is to select a map type and file format. Under “Map Type” drop box, you can select
“balanced” or “unbalanced” map. A generation map with non-missing data from any generation is
called balanced generation map. A generation map with missing data from the higher generation
selected is called unbalanced generation map. For the output example on the next page, we
selected “unbalanced”.

Under “File Format”, select a wide or long file, depending on whether you want to work with a
file that has one observation per individual (wide), or one observation per relationship (long). If
you are linking with your CDS data file, select WIDE and then check the box that says “Merge
with CDS Map”. This will give you relationships only for CDS-I baseline participants. Under
“Output Options”, you can select your analysis program format – SAS, SPSS, Stata, or Excel.


CDS-III User Guide Page 86


Among the variables that will be outputted in your GID file from FIMS are the identifiers for
biological parents and grandparents. Note that maternal and paternal grandparents are identified
separately.

```
ER30001  LABEL="CHILD: 1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER"

ER30002  LABEL="CHILD: PERSON NUMBER 68"

ER30001_P_F  LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /PARENT /FATHER"

ER30002_P_F  LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /PARENT /FATHER"

ER30001_P_M  LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /PARENT /MOTHER"

ER30002_P_M  LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /PARENT /MOTHER"

ER30001_GP_FF LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF FATHER"

ER30002_GP_FF LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF FATHER"

ER30001_GP_FM LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF MOTHER"

ER30002_GP_FM LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF MOTHER"

ER30001_GP_MF LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF FATHER"

ER30002_GP_MF LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF FATHER"

ER30001_GP_MM LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF MOTHER"

ER30002_GP_MM LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF MOTHER"

```

For GID data files that are merged with the CDS Map, you will also get the primary and
secondary caregiver ID68 and PN variables. You are then ready to link your map file with your
CDS child-level file – the linkage should be done with ER30001 and ER30002 combined, the
unique identifiers per CDS-Individual and will follow the same steps as described above for
caregiver map file.

## Chapter 15 – A Few Tips on Using the PSID-CDS Data Resources

Admittedly, the PSID-TA-CDS data are complex data resources that may appear difficult to use
at first glance. The key to using the CDS, TA, and PSID data, however, lies in understanding the
basic data structure before jumping in and downloading variables across multiple years of
collection for multiple individuals in the child’s family.

Remember that CDS children are individuals in the PSID panel of families where we collected
more in-depth information about them, individually, where the main PSID data collection does
not. This means that the CDS kids have data in the PSID main archive (not just the parents or
caregivers) as well as in the CDS-specific data collections (including CDS-I, CDS-II, CDS-III,
TA 2005, and TA 2007).

In the PSID, the data are collected at a family level, with some individual-level details. But the
bulk of the data revolve around the persons who are Heads and Wives of the households. In the
CDS, the data are collected mainly at the individual-level, revolving around the children. Some
information, however, is collected about the caregivers/parents, who may be Heads or Wives in
the PSID. A first tip to using the data is to review the chapters on PSID and CDS data structure in
this guide to get a firm grasp on data structure for both data collections. It is well-worth the time
investment to become familiar with basic concepts prior to attempting data downloads so you
know what to expect and how to merge.

The CDS-Itself has multiple modules, collected from multiple individuals in the family. The User
Guides provide survey and sample design information, historical context of the study,
documentation about specific scales and indices that the CDS staff generated for public use, and
data structure of the PSID. Questionnaires are also posted for both CDS and PSID. For detailed
listing of measures by module and for a comparison of measures with other large-scale public use
datasets on children and adolescents, see:

[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/researchdesign.html](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/researchdesign.html)

.

Questionnaires are provided on web pages:


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/quescodetable.html (for CDS)
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data/zipCore.aspx (for PSID)


We additionally encourage you to review the “Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for both PSID
and CDS: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/FAQ.aspx. This webpage gives a quick overview
of some key concepts in both projects.


Next, take the opportunity to review the tutorials posted on the PSID website. These tutorials
provide step-by-step instructions on downloading and analyzing the data in a variety of ways,
including: cross-sectional analyses, tracking longitudinal changes, creating and analyzing a
balanced panel, creating and analyzing a customized subset of CDS modules, and merging PSID
and CDS data together for intergenerational analysis. These tutorials also help to understand
PSID file structure, identification numbers, and how to obtain caregiver data about the CDS target
children/youth. They can be found at:

The Data Center is the most popular means for obtaining PSID data and it delivers about 10,000
customized data files to researchers and quantitative social science students each year. The Data
Center is fully automated and allows for user-specified subsetting criteria when downloading and
merging main family and main individual data files. ASCII or SAS data files can be generated,
along with SAS, SPSS, and Stata data definition statements.

In addition to the Data Center, data and documentation can also be obtained from the PSID Web
site in the form of prepackaged files. Data files and SAS and SPSS data definition statements are
available via the documentation page and Anonymous FTP. Data from the Geocode files, Death
files, and Medicare files are available by special contract. See the PSID Overview page or contact
PSID Help for more information.

Each time you go to the Data Center to download data, visit the Data News page
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/DataNews.aspx to see if any modifications to existing files
or new files have been posted. Sign up for email alerts when new data or data sharing tools are
released.

17 An underlined question number indicates that the item was asked of the cohort, but is not part of the NLSY subscale and therefore not used in the construction
of the summary variable for Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales in the CDS-II data. An empty shade cell indicates that the item is not part of
the NLSY subscale and therefore not used in the construction of the summary variable for Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales in the CDS-II
data. An italic question number indicates that the item was asked of the cohort, and it is part of the NLSY subscale, but it was not used to construct the summary
variable for Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales in the CDS-II data because of a significant number of missing data.
