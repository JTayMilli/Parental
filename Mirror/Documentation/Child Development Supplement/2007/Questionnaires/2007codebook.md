TIME DIARY GENERAL EDITING INSTRUCTIONS

All diary activity editing is to be done in red pencil.

If editing causes additional activity lines to be added, number the additional ones as follows, using
decimals: if activity 5 is edited to three activities, they should be numbered 5, 5.1, 5.2.

T1 Day of the Week (on the cover)

1 Monday 6 Saturday
2 Tuesday 7 Sunday
3 Wednesday
4 Thursday
5 Friday

A1-A4 Check the last page of the diary (p. 16). Make sure these items are legibly marked or written in.

COLUMN A What did you do?

Use the Activity Code list (pp. 12-47)
EXCEPT:

If R has given no activities or 1 or 2 activities for the whole day, NA the diary as follows:


COL A. TIME BEGAN TIME ENDED Columns D-J = 0

4810 00:00 24:00

5790

COLUMNS B AND C TIME BEGAN and TIME END

Total Time for activities done on the specified diary day must equal exactly 24 hours . Code the
diary beginning at 0000 (midnight) and ending at 2400, the following midnight, by using a 24hour
clock or military time. (The first 2 digits represent the hour in the 24-hour sequence and the
last 2 digits represent the minutes, so 7:23 p.m. is written as 19:23.) Check to see that the "TIME
ENDED" for each activity is the same as the "TIME BEGAN" for the next activity, e.g.:

Drove to the store 12:30 - **12:45**
Shopped for a hammer **12:45**    - 12:55


1


COLUMN D If the activity is TV, video, games, computer, software, or books:

00. INAP 05. X-box
01. Video Tape (VHS) 06. Computer
02. Television Program (TV) 07. Cell Phone
03. DVD 08. Books

04. I-pod or other MP3 97. Other
99.  NA

COLUMN E What was the name of the (program/video/game/book)?


Enter text verbatim (to be coded later) leave blank if INAP. Code each program, video, or game as
a separate activity. (NOTE: Media coding will not be done by SRO).


**Columns D and E Editing Information**


One outstanding problem with Columns D and E and the splits that come up for television programs (pg. 13
codebook) and videogames and computer games (pg. 20).


1. We never put anything into col. D or E. If the R says watching TV is the primary or secondary
activity or computer/videogames are being played, we do not "transfer" information into cols. D

and E.


2. We do split activities, if necessary, with information out of cols. D and E. See pages 13 and 20. We
split activity lines under certain conditions for TV programs and computer/videogames.


3. We are not interested in other electronic devices, only TV, computers, and videogames.


4. The Child was informed to fill out column D and E if the activity was a primary or secondary
activity.


COLUMN F If you accessed the Internet to do this activity what website(s) did you use?
Enter text verbatim. Leave blank if INAP.

COLUMN G Where were you?

10. HOME, R's yard

20. TRANSIT (car, bus, walking, biking)

30. PARENT’S PLACE OF WORK

35. CHILD’S PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT

40. Someone else's home (outside or inside); "at neighbor's"
or at babysitter’s or home-based day care

45. Child’s other parent’s home


50. Restaurants, bars, fast-food places and their parking lots


2


60. Indoor recreation places (theatres, youth recreation center)

70. Outdoor recreation places (parks, R's neighborhood); "outside" if "home"
not checked

80. SCHOOL (includes college)

81. Church

82. Stores, shopping centers, malls and their parking lots, beauty parlor

83. Banks, offices, library, fire station

84. Daycare center (not home-based day care)

97. Other, hospital, parking structure

99. NA


00. Inap, Primary activity coded 4810 or 9840

**Editing cols. H and I**


Columns H and I may have the people in the wrong location. Often the Child will put the people into the
wrong column, and it can be a judgment call whether to “shift” people around. The best thing to do is look
at the preceding activity, and the following activity. Are they connected to the present activity? Do not be
afraid to do this if there is a strong suspicion the Child may have filled column H or I incorrectly.


COLUMNS H and I Who was doing ...? and Who (else) was there ...?


A. No one

1. checked 0. not checked

B. Mother

1. checked 0. not checked

C. Father

1. checked 0. not checked

D. Brother or sister

1. checked 0. not checked

E. Step-mother
1. checked 0. not checked

F. Step-father
1. checked 0. not checked

G. Step-brother or sister
1. checked 0. not checked


3


H. (Child) Friend of child
1. checked 0. not checked

I. Grandparent or great grandparent of child
1. checked 0. not checked

J. Other relative of child

1. checked 0. not checked


K. Other non relative of child (team mates)
1. checked 0. not checked

Notes: H. includes any non-adult, non-relative that the child is “playing” with.
K. includes mom’s live-in boyfriend, and teammates.

COLUMN J What else were you doing at the same time?


Use the Activity Code list (pp. 12-47)

RECORDING ACTIVITIES

Generally, primary and secondary activities and times should be coded as the interviewer has
recorded them. An activity listed as a primary will remain a primary activity unless travel is the
concurrent activity (see Travel, page 15). Secondary activities remain as secondary activities
unless:


1. The secondary is traveling.
2. The secondary could not possibly be done while doing the primary activity.
3. The secondary is night’s sleep.

COMBINING ACTIVITIES

When adjacent primary activities fall into the same code category, code them separately as they
are recorded in the diary; do not group them together except in the case of work activities and
school activities (going to and from classes at school) when Columns G, H, I and J remain the

same.

GAPS

If there are gaps in the time, edit them using the following instructions.

When a gap of 10 minutes or less exists between the time an activity ended and the next activity
began, allocate 1/2 of the time to the activity preceding the gap and 1/2 of the time to the activity
following the gap.

Below are examples of unedited and edited time gaps:

Showered 7:10 - 7:25

Ate breakfast 7:35 - 7:55



4


7:30

Showered 7:10 ~~-7:25~~

Ate breakfast ~~7:35~~     - 7:55

7:30

If the gap is longer than 10 minutes, edit a "TIME BEGAN" and "TIME ENDED" for this time
period in the space between activities, label the activity NA and code 4810. Code the "TIME
BEGAN" and "TIME ENDED" for the NA activity, and code "O" in Columns D through J.

OVERLAPS

When there is an overlap in time periods, calculate the overlap time periods, and divide it equally
between the two activities by subtracting 1/2 the overlapping time from the ending time of the last
activity and adding the other 1/2 of the overlapping time to the beginning time of the second
activity.

Below are examples of unedited and edited overlaps in time:

Watched TV 11:00 - 12:00
Eating 11:40 - 12:15

11:50

Watched TV 11:00 ~~-12:00~~
Eating ~~11:40~~     - 12:15
11:50

In this example, there is a 20 minute overlap which is divided equally into two 10 minute time
segments. Ten minutes is then subtracted from the time spent "WATCHING TV" and converted
into clock time. The other 10 minutes is added onto the time spent "EATING" and converted
into clock time.

If a secondary activity is recorded, enter it (as usual) with the primary activity it is associated
with, even though the time will be shortened or lengthened in the same amount as its primary.

ALLOCATING ODD MINUTES

In dividing time for gaps, overlaps, and splitting multiple mentions (which will be covered later),
often an even split of minutes will not be possible. In this case, allocate the extra minute to the
first activity involved.

ACTIVITY BY OTHERS

When R reports an activity done by someone other than her/himself, check the secondary activity
to try and ascertain what R was doing. Cross out what others were doing with a single line and
draw an arrow from R's activity to the primary activity column, assuming the time period is the
same, and Columns D through H remain the same, and there are no secondary activities. If unable
to ascertain R's activity, cross out what the other people were doing with a single line, write in
NA, and code 9840 (activities of others reported). Code the "TIME BEGAN" and "TIME
ENDED" for the segment and code "O" in Columns D through J. (See "HELPING",
"WAITING" and "ACCOMPANYING", p.12)



5


PUBLIC PLACES

In the H/I columns, busdriver/students/classmates all get coded as “K. Other non-relatives of
child. **”** If in a public place, store, bus, etc., assume there is other non-relative present. It also gets
coded as “K- other non-relative of child. **”**

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR 4080, 4090, 4110/4880

If the child is receiving help from an adult or caregiver, under the H column, it will always be a
4880 regardless of age, or if Col A says received help. If R is 3 or under and no one is mentioned in
the H column it will always be coded 4880. If no one is mentioned in the H column and R is 4 or
over it will be coded 4080, 4090, or 4110. If this is unclear see supervisor.
(NOTE: In 2007 CDS, all respondents are 10-18 years old.)



6


PRIMARY ACTIVITIES

REPORTING

In all cases where an activity is reported as a primary activity it will remain a primary activity
except where travel has been listed as a secondary activity (see "SECONDARY ACTIVITIES:
TRAVEL", p. 9).

MULTIPLE PRIMARIES: SEPARATE CODES

If more than one primary activity is listed for a segment of time, divide the time evenly between
the activities listed, e.g.:

Example A: Prepared and ate dinner 6:00 - 7:00

would look like the following after editing:

Prepared 6:00 - 6:30
Ate dinner 6:30 - 7:00

Example B: Washed up, ate breakfast, read 8:00 - 9:00

paper

would look like the following after editing:

Washed up 8:00 - 8:20
Ate breakfast 8:20 - 8:40

Read paper 8:40 - 9:00

MULTIPLE PRIMARIES: SAME CODE

However, if the multiple primary activities fall into the same activity code category, such as
"making beds, vacuuming, and dusting," do not divide the segment of time, but code as one
primary activity.

COMBINATION

When three or more primary activities are grouped together in one time segment and some fall
into the same code category and some do not, split the time proportionately among all the listed
activities, then divide the activities according to the code categories and their order of mention.

Unedited and edited versions of combinations follow:



7


Example A: Made beds, vacuumed, ate lunch 11:00 - 12:30

Made beds, vacuumed 11:00 - 12:00
Ate lunch 12:00 - 12:30

Example B: Made beds, ate lunch, vacuumed11:00 - 12:30

Made beds 11:00 - 11:30

Ate lunch 11:30 - 12:00

Vacuumed 12:00 - 12:30

COMMON SENSE

If in following any of these editing instructions, a clearly nonsensical record would be produced,
see supervisor.

Nonsensical example:

Put on swimsuit and sunbathed 1:00 - 3:30

Following the splitting multiple primary rule, would be:

Put on swimsuit 1:00 - 2:15

Sunbathed 2:15 - 3:30

Clearly, this creates a ridiculous amount of time for the dressing code and should be modified with
the aid of the editing supervisor.

ACTIVITIES TAKING 1 MINUTE OR LESS

If an activity normally takes one minute or less to do and is not allocated a time period of its own
in the diary, cross it out with a single line.

Example: Got in car and rode home 9:00 - 9:15

rode home 9:00 - 9:15

WAITING

Whenever possible, code "waiting for" event to begin/place to open/plane to arrive, etc. as part of
the activity being waited for, so that "waiting for stores to open" while at the mall to shop is
Shopping 3020 and waiting for someone's plane to arrive is part picking someone up (helping) at
the airport.



8


SECONDARY ACTIVITIES


REPORTING

A secondary activity is left as a secondary unless:

1. It is travel.

2. It cannot reasonably be done concurrently with the primary activity (e.g.,
primary= watch TV, secondary= mow the lawn).
3. It is night's sleep.

TRAVEL

If the secondary activity is travel from one place to another, move it to the primary column and
the primary activity listed may be moved to the secondary column, or split, depending on the
primary activity.

(NOTE: This is one exception where an activity listed as primary does not always remain
primary.) If travel occurred as a portion of the primary activity, split the primary according to
travel splitting rules.

Example of reversed primary and secondary:

Primary Secondary
Listen to the news Rode to school

Since it appears these are concurrent activities and travel must be the primary, reverse the position
of these to:

Primary Secondary
Rode to school Listen to the news

NON-CONCURRENT

If the secondary activity cannot be done at the same time as the primary activity:

1. Cross it out as secondary.
2. Edit it into Column A beneath the associated primary.
3. Divide the time equally between the primary activities.
4. Code Columns G through J the same.

An example of an unedited and edited non-concurrent activity follows:



9


Column A: What did you do? Column J: What else?
Dressed for school 8:00 - 8:45 Did dishes

Edited:

Dressed for school 8:00 - 8:23

Did dishes 8:23 - 8:45

MULTIPLE SECONDARIES

When there is more than one secondary activity listed for one time segment:

1. Cross out the extra secondary with a single line and edit it into a new/split activity line.
2. Record the same primary activity on this line.
3. Divide the time segment equally.

Column A: What did you do? Column J: What else?

Ate dinner 5:00 - 6:00 Talked with brother, read paper

Edited:

Ate dinner 5:00 - 5:30 Talked with brother
Ate dinner 5:30 - 6:00 Read paper

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY THE SAME ACTIVITY CODE

If the secondary activity uses the same code as the primary activity, cross it out and code no
secondary activity.

If a secondary activity just describes the primary activity in more detail, cross out the secondary
activity, e.g.:

Column A: What did you do? Column J: What else?


Visited the neighbors Looked at their flower bed

Would become:


Visited the neighbors

INTERMITTENT SECONDARY ACTIVITY

If a secondary activity is reported as being done "IN AND OUT" of the primary activity (or
"BACK AND FORTH," "PART OF THE TIME") split the primary and code half of the time with
the secondary and half without.



10


NA DIARY

If R has given no activities or 1 or 2 activities for the whole day, NA the diary as follows:

ACTIVITY TIME BEGAN TIME ENDED columns D-J = 0

4810 00:00 24:00

5790



11


ACTIVITY CODE INSTRUCTIONS

GETTING UP/GOING TO BED

1. The phrases "GOING TO BED" and "GETTING UP" are only coded as activities if the
segment of time is allotted to them, in which case code "4070", otherwise cross them out.
Example: Got up 8:00 Went to school 8:00 - 8:15

2. However, if there's a gap in the morning between "GETTING UP" and, for example,
"LEAVING FOR SCHOOL", allot that time period for "GETTING UP", code 4070.

HELPING ("helped clean the garage")

Helping other adults in household -- code the task being performed as R's activity.
Helping children in household -- code under child care, 2210 or 2220.
Helping someone outside household -- code 4220, 4230 or 4240.
Children helping with household tasks -- code the task performed as the child's activity _regardless_
_of whether or not the child would make a significant contribution to the activity._ (The child’s age
should indicate the level of the contribution to the analyst.)

Activities are coded as help and care to adults in HH, relatives, neighbors or friends (4210, 4220,
4230, 4240) only when helping another seems to be the primary goal of the activity more than the
actual activity (a household chore or leisure, for example) is a joint activity of the respondent and
the individual who appears to be receiving help.

SHOPPING

Beware of where R went shopping. If one segment of time is listed for "WENT SHOPPING" and
multiple places are specified in Column D or elsewhere, divide according to multiple primary
rules. Do not automatically code 3020 -- shopping.

WAITING

If the waiting does not fall into Code 9970 (waiting in car), then code the waiting in the specific
OTHER category under what they are waiting for (e.g., **“** WAITING TO EAT **”** - code 4890). If
what the child is waiting for cannot be determined, code 4890 -- waiting for personal care. If a
child is accompanying a parent and does not seemed to be directly involved in the purpose of the
trip, Code 9980 (Travel of child with adult) for both the travel and waiting.

"SAT AND ..."

Do not code the sitting, just the other activity (TALKED, READ, etc.).



12


FEEDING CHILDREN AGES 4 AND UNDER

If R says he/she "FED KIDS" and this includes both fixing and serving food to children ages 4 and
under, code 1/2 the time Meal Preparation (1080 or 1090) and the other 1/2 Baby Care (2090).

FEEDING CHILDREN OVER AGE 4 AND UNDER AGE 4

If "FEEDING CHILDREN" over 4 and under 4. split as above.

FEEDING CHILDREN ALL OVER AGE 4

If "FEEDING CHILDREN" all over 4, code Meal Preparation (1080-1090) only.

TV WATCHING

If the television is on, under the D column, but television is not listed as a primary or secondary
activity, it needs to be split. TV watching (9190) becomes a secondary activity. Split it
accordingly, if necessary. The program name will not be entered. If more than one television
program is mentioned and TV watching is the secondary activity (as in this case), do not split for
each program.

CONVENTIONS ON PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES

The following times should be used when activities listed below must be split from other
activities:

Activity Time Assumed

1890 Feeding pets 5 minutes
1890 Letting pets in or out 2 minutes
4090 Dressing/getting ready 10 minutes
4490 Eating out 30 minutes
4090 "GOING TO THE JOHN" 3 minutes
6520 Praying (meal time/bed time) 2 minutes
7990 Walking to neighbor's, friend's 2 minutes
or other nearby place
4390 Meals at home 30 minutes
4480 Meals away from home
at friend’s/relative’s 30 minutes

When you need to split activities from
night's sleep as in "WENT TO BED AND ...":
assume reading (9390), meditating (6520) or
any other activities 30 minutes

These allocations should be used even if splitting the activities produces a smaller amount of time
for the other activity.



13


PAID WORK

If R works or does something for someone, e.g. rake leaves, we will assume it was without pay
unless they specifically say they were paid. These will be coded as 4230, 4240, etc.

ANIMAL CARE

Beware of distinction between, 1890, playing and caring for pets, and 8440, care for
animals/livestock. An animal will be considered a pet if it is an animal that commonly comes
inside.



14


TRAVEL

SELECTION OF TRAVEL CODE BY PURPOSE OF TRIP

The travel code is generally associated with the purpose of the trip, both going to and coming
back from. For example, if "DROVE TO THE GROCERY STORE" took 10 minutes and
"DROVE HOME" took another 10 minutes, code each 10 minute segment as travel related to
shopping.

TRAVEL CODING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES AT ONE LOCATION

The travel code used is dependent on the activity the Child is going to, or the activities that form the bulk of
the time of the activities. However, if multiple primary activities are engaged in, then the travel should be
coded to the largest block of time.

For example, let's say the Child goes to a friend’s house and does a 7000 activity for the largest block of
time but also does an 8000 activity, and a 9000 activity.  The travel code would be a 7990 for this example.

Also, if the R is returning home from his friend's home, the travel code would "double back" and also be
7990. All travel codes are outward looking to where the child is going and the primary activity, or activities,
when they arrive there. The only time it "looks backward" is on travel home. That travel code is then
dependent on where the R is coming from and the activity (or longest in duration) that they are coming
from. Also, activity codes are cumulative in duration. For example, two 8000 activity codes of twenty
minutes duration each (equaling 40 minutes) will outweigh a 7000 activity code of 35 minutes duration.

ALWAYS PRIMARY (The nineties--0990, 2990, etc.--of each heading except HOUSEHOLD)

Travel can never be a secondary activity. When travel is reported as a secondary activity and it is
a non-concurrent activity:

1. Cross it out and move it to the primary column under the primary it was listed
with.

2. Split the time according to NO TRAVEL REPORTED rules, pages 16-17.
3. Edit Column G to "TRANSIT".

4. Assume Columns H and I are the same as for the associated primary unless noted
otherwise.
5. Assume there is no secondary activity.

When travel is reported as secondary activity and it is going on concurrently with the primary
activity:

1. Draw a double pointed arrow from it to the primary activity.
2. Change their places when numbering and coding.

MULTIPLE PURPOSE TRIPS

In the case of a trip that had multiple purposes, e.g.,

Biked to the drugstore
Picked up a prescription


15


Biked to my friend's house
Visited

Biked home

code each travel segment as travel related to the next primary activity, then code the last segment
of the trip ("BIKED HOME") as travel time related to the last activity ("VISITED").

TRAVEL MODE

Assume travel mode remains the same for all travel when editing multiple trips unless noted
otherwise.

TRIP WITHIN A TRIP

If there is a clear trip within a trip, then code travel to and from as you would if R went there and
back from home.

EXAMPLE CODE

Drove to church 6990

Drove to store 3990
Bought pacifier 3020
Drove back to church 3990

Went to church 6510

Drove home 6990

SHOPPING TRAVEL

Code "PICKED UP FRIEND TO GO SHOPPING" as shopping-related travel (3990), not visitingrelated travel.

TRANSPORTING OTHERS

In general, code the travel time related to the purpose of the trip, e.g., "TAKING SOMEONE
ELSE TO SCHOOL" (if R is not going to school), code 4980--travel related to helping others.

SCHOOL TRAVEL

Travel related to school (codes 5970, 5980) is to capture only the time R spends commuting to get
to his/her school and to get back home from school (at the end of R's school day). Any
intervening trips are to be coded as travel related to the purpose of the activity (e.g., travel to and
from lunch will be coded as travel related to personal care). Field trips during regular school
hours do not get included as a separate activity. They are included in 5090 as an in-class activity.

NO TRAVEL REPORTED, SINGLE TRIP: SHORT ACTIVITY (90 minutes or less)

If travel has not been reported and travel is implied by a change of place, and the activity reported
was 90 minutes or less (allow 1/2 of the total time spent for travel). Split the travel time in half
and show half (1/4 of the activity time) to get to the activity and half (other 1/4 of total activity
time) to get home. An unedited and edited example follows:

Went to grandmother's house 9:30 - 10:30



16


Travel to grandmother's house 9:30 - 9:45
Visited grandmother 9:45 - 10:15
Travel home 10:15 - 10:30

NO TRAVEL REPORTED, SINGLE TRIP: LONG ACTIVITY (over 90 minutes)

If travel has not been reported and travel is implied by a change of place, and the activity was over
90 minutes, assume total travel time was 45 minutes of the activity and edit in 23 minutes travel
there and 22 minutes travel back (unless you have reason to believe otherwise).

TRAVEL REPORTED; ONE WAY
If travel is reported one way, with the same start or end point, code the same amount of time for
the missing trip segment.

ERRANDS
If R says **“** errands, **”** multiple of errands unspecified code 3890. Use no travel time reported, single
trip coding rules.

NO TRAVEL REPORTED: ADJACENT ACTIVITIES

When travel is omitted from two (or more) adjacent activities:

1. Take the travel time getting from one activity to the other from the longer activity (of the
two), using appropriate editing instructions for travel not reported.

2. Then, from the shorter activity of the two, take 1/4 of the time for travel and the rest for
the activity.

EXAMPLE:

PRIMARY ACT TIME REPORTED TIME EDITED

To the grocery store 1 hr. 15 min. travel
45 min. shopping

To the laundromat 2 hrs. 23 min. travel
75 min. at laundry
22 min. travel

To the shopping center 1 hr. 45 min. shopping
15 min. travel

EXCEPTION TO NO TRAVEL REPORTED

If travel has not been reported and R went next door, or down the street, or somewhere else close
by, allow two minutes going and two minutes coming back from the time the activity took (unless
activity took less than 5 minutes, then see supervisor).



17


NO TIME SPENT AT PLACE TRAVELED TO

Assume these are very brief "drop off" stops of a minute or less and code as recorded unless
nonsense result is produced. If it is clear that a significant amount of the time mentioned was
spent at an unmentioned activity, use regular splitting rules. If activity is "drove to movies" and
time is 3 hours, assume/split to include attending the movie. If in doubt, see supervisor.

PLEASURE DRIVING

Code "DRIVING AROUND," "OUT FOR A RIDE," etc. as 8170. NOTE: 8170 is not a
"TRAVEL CODE" in that there is no destination and may be left as a secondary activity.



18


GUIDELINES FOR CODING CHILD DIARIES

SECONDARY ACTIVITIES--DON'T KNOW

If "DON'T KNOW" is written in Column J, secondary activity column, treat as if there were no
secondary activity (0).

HELPING OR ACCOMPANYING ACTIVITIES

When the diary child is helping someone else do something, the activity he/she is helping with
should be coded. However, in the case where a child reports helping another child with what is a
"play" activity, code the appropriate "playing" code (8660-8890) unless there is an indication that
child care was taking place (such as an age difference as well as activity description of helping), in
which case you should see your supervisor. When a child is accompanying a parent and does not
seemed to be directly involved in the purpose of the trip, Code 9980 (Travel of child with adult) for
both the travel and waiting.

PLAYING

Playing needs to be very carefully coded by the type of interactions the child is having. Most of
the playing categories are together under the category of playing on page 44. But other activities
which are considered play may more accurately be coded by the action, rather than with one of
the general playing categories. For instance, playing a "pick up game" or unofficial game of baseball would
be 8010, doing yoga would be coded 8080, official team games or practice would be 8830, tennis lessons
would be 8850, and hiking would be 8220.

Identifying social games or interactions with others (8730) may not be immediately obvious. An
activity is not a social game just because it is a game where others are doing the activity with the
child. Instead, the question is the nature of the playing which is taking place. For instance,
playing tag would be a social game but running (8230) or catch (8070) would not. While playing
tag, a primary component of the activity is interacting with each other. With running or catch, the
purpose is more likely developing physical ability rather the human relationship. Jumping rope or
doing hand clap or string games is also interactive and a primary component of the activity in a
way that is not true for singing (8620).

If no descriptive information is available other than the word "play" or "playing," then code the
activity as unspecified playing (8770).

PLAYING WITH BABIES

"Playing with babies" code 2480 (household babies, age 0-2) or 2780 (non-household babies, age 0-2).
However, these are childcare codes and should only be used when the child whose activities
are being coded is an older child. If the child whose activities are being coded is young (under 6),
these activities should be coded as social playing or playing where others were present.


19


SCHOOL

Assume household children who attend school are "full-time" students where you must distinguish
among categories on this basis.

SCHOOL TRAVEL

Travel to and from school by children can be coded one of the following three ways:

1) If the child travels directly from his/her home to school without stops or interruptions,
code 5970.

2) If the child travels directly from school to home without any stops or interruptions, code
5980.

3) If the child travels to school from someplace other than home (e.g., from the babysitter's),
code 5990. Travel from school to a destination other than home (e.g., a friend's house, or
the drug store) should be coded as travel to that destination (e.g., 3990 would describe
travel to the drug store after school). If it seems awkward to code travel from school to a
destination other than home (for instance, if the stop can't really be described as a
destination), check with a supervisor.

OTHER 5990 CODES
5990=to the bus stop.
5990=bus stop to school
5990=daycare to school
5990=school to daycare

COMPUTER GAMES/VIDEO GAMES/TV

If multiple computer or video games are mentioned in Column E in connection with primary
activity codes 5020 or 8790, split the activity and time accordingly. If multiple television programs
or videos are mentioned in Column E in connection with primary activity code 9190, split the
activity and time accordingly.

COMPUTERS FOR HOMEWORK

If a student is using a computer for homework, regardless of the kind of task, it should be coded
5040.



20


WORK AND OTHER INCOME PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

PAID WORK

x0110. “Normal”/regular full-time paid work: Activities at the main job including work brought
home, travel which is part of the job, and overtime; **“** working, **”** **“** at work. **”**

x0120. Work at home; work activities for pay done in the home when home is the main

NOTES

When Principal Place of Employment is Home:

When R's principal place of employment is home (as with a farmer), R's work activities are
coded "120" and Col. G is coded "10", not "30".

Those activity codes designed specifically to capture non-work activities (690, 680, 890,780) at the
workplace do not apply when work is coded "120".

For example, if R baby-sits for pay at home, all eating and drinking is coded "4390".

### **APPENDIX A - NOTES FROM 2008 CODING**



48


distributed 7/22/2008

#### **Shortcuts and Editing notes for Time Diaries**


This is a crib sheet for some of the things you should know about editing time diaries.
These are some of the more important things to know but it is **not meant as** a replacement for
knowing your editing instructions.


1. Who is doing what/around . Page 3. Remember, we assume Kin all public places for column I.


2. Time gaps. Page 4. Use 4810 (missing time)if more than 10 minutes. Less than 10 minutes, edit
into the two activities, and odd minutes go to the first activity.


3. Transit (travel). If in a car or other vehicle, there is nothing in the I column, and everyone is in
the H column. We use K for the bus driver, or others, non-family/friends, if need be.


4. Splitting activity lines. See page 10. If more than one secondary activity, then split time equally,
keeping the primary activity. If there a re 3 secondary activities, for example, then make 3 activity

lines.


5. Secondary activities. See page 9.


6. If the primary and secondary activities have the same code, cross out the secondary activity. See
page 10.


7. “Waiting for”, code into the appropriate travel code, or the appropriate “_970” code. See page

12.


8. Time conventions on certain activities- if splitting is necessary. See page 13.


9. Travel. Remember, it’s when the R is going outward from home you need to look at the next
activity to figure out the right travel code to use. It’s the purpose of the trip. When returning home
is when it “doubles back” and you need to look at where they came from. The previous activity
(location) tells you what travel code to use then. See pages 15 and 16.


10. Travel not reported or time not reported. You may need to write in new activity lines for travel.
See page 16 and 17. There are different rules for more than and less than 90 minutes.


11. “Errands” is code 3890. Pleasure driving is code 8170, and there are no travel activities
associated with 8170. See page 17.


49


12 Helping others. See pages 12 and 19.


13. The TV is on under column D. Code this as a secondary activity, and if there already is a
secondary activity you’ll need to maker a new activity line splitting the time and keeping the
original primary activity. Do not include this in column D of the new activity line. This may be
revised to include other electronic devices found in column D. This decision is pending.


14. School travel.


5970= travel direct to school


5980=travel direct school to home


5990= travel to school in segments. Home to the bus stop, and bus stop to school. Also
include daycare here as an intermediate step.


See page 20.


15. Playing, see page 19.


16. In elementary, junior high, and senior high school. The only activities we care about are
breakfast, lunch, and field trips. Everything else in school is a 5090 activity code. You may need to
edit out some activity lines. See page 32.


Again, these are not all the rules, but some of the most important. Learn your editing rules, and the
codes and you’ll do a good job.

#### **Additional PSID Time Diary Notes, Instructions, and Changes**


Please enter this into your codebook. It is **very important** that you write these changes into
your codebooks. I would recommend you do it sooner than later so you don’t forget.


1. On page 3, on who was doing the activity with or there, delete “team-mate” from H and add to

K.


2. Delete activity 8150 on page 42.


3. Add to activity 5100. “Using the computer for” media reading newspapers, stock quotes,
weather reports.


4. Delete “SPECIFY DURING DDE” or “PLEASE SPECIFY” from codes 5690 and 8890.


5. Add to code 8242, “or snowmobiles”.


6 Add to code 3010. “using the phone to order take out food”.


7. Delete from code 3790, the example “Returned books to the library”


Most library mentions use code 5493.


8. On page 2 for column D. All categories should have a lead “0”. The code range is 00-09.


9. On page 3 for column G, insert new code 35 for “Child’s workplace”


10. On page 3 for column G, change code 89 to 97.


11. Code 9890, delete “laughing”. All “laughing” mentions now go to code 4850.


12. Code 5990, change to read, “Other school/education related travel” instead of “Other school

related”.


13. Codes 5090, 5091, 5092, 5093, and 5691. Put an x next to these. Than the note at the bottom of

the page, ‘These get padded out of columns H, I, and J.” You do not have to fill out those columns

for those codes.


14. Codes 0110, 0120, and 0590. Put an x next to these. The rest of the instruction as found in

point 13 above.


15. Instruction to write in on page 20.


51


**Columns D and E Editing Information**


One outstanding problem with Columns D and E and the splits that come up for television
programs (pg. 13 codebook) and videogames and computer games (pg. 20).


1. We never put anything into col. D or E. If the R says watching TV is the primary or secondary
activity or computer/videogames are being played, we do not "transfer" information into cols. D

and E.


2. We do split activities, if necessary, with information out of cols. D and E. See pages 13 and 20.
We split activity lines under certain conditions for TV programs and computer/videogames.


3. We are not interested in other electronic devices, only TV, computers, and videogames.


4. The Child was informed to fill out column D and E if the activity was a primary or secondary
activity.


**Editing cols. H and I**


Columns H and I may have the people in the wrong location. Often the Child will put the
people into the wrong column, and it can be a judgment call whether to “shift” people around. The
best thing to do is look at the preceding activity, and the following activity. Are they connected to
the present activity? Do not be afraid to do this if there is a strong suspicion the Child may have
filled column H or I incorrectly.


**Missing Coversheet Information**


If there is missing information on the coversheet as you prepare to do data entry of the
Time Diary, please stop, fill out a problem form, and place in the problem box. This is important

information that will need to be filled in from another information source.

Subject: columns D and E in the Time Diaries, primary and secondary activities

As you might know we had some debates going on about how to handle columns D
and E in the Time Diaries along with secondary activities. We looked at many

TDs from the last wave.

Our findings:

1. Nothing gets edited into columns D and E from the secondary activities.

2. Columns D and E are only to be used in conjunction with the primary
activity.

3. If they have an activity in D and E that is not a primary activity, it
should be made into a secondary activity, and split if there is already a
secondary in that activity line.

4. The interviewers edited, in green pencil, many things into columns D and E
from the secondary activity. These things should be crossed out or, preferably,

erased.

Let's keep this real simple for editing.

1. Nothing goes into D and E from the secondary.

2. The only time to put in a new secondary code is when there are activities in

2. Time before and after school at school. The kid is hanging out waiting for
class to start or the bus to leave at the end of the day. The kid doesn't say
this, but you know this is what is happening, but if there's a time gap here of
more than 10 minutes it should be coded as 4810, missing time.

1. Page 13, Eating out and in- 30 minutes

2. This is highly suggested- probably on page 10. The travel code used is
dependent on the activity the Child is going to, or the activities that form
the bulk of the time of the activities. For example, let's say the Child is
going to a friends house and does a 7000 activity while there, an 8000
activity, and a 9000 activity. Which ever of the three activities has the
largest percentage of time, will have the associated travel code used to go to
that friends house. Thus the travel code would be a 7990, if of the three
activities, the 7000 was the longest in time duration. Also, if the R is
returning home from his friend's home, the travel code would "double back" and
also be 7990. All travel codes are outward looking" to where the child is going
and the primary activity, or activities, when they arrive there. The only time
it "looks backward" is on travel home. That travel code is then dependent on
where the R is coming from and the activity (or longest in duration) that they
are coming from. Also, activity codes are cumulative in duration. For example,
two 8000 activity codes of twenty minutes duration each (equaling 40 minutes)
will outweigh a 7000 activity code of 35 minutes duration.

Subject: Who else is there/ columns H and I

A few general guidelines on this. They are general because each TD has
different information we can make assumptions or informed decisions with.

1. If someone is in the HH early in the morning or late at night, especially
both, they are probably HH members.

2. If only a first name is given, see what activities this person is involved
in and with whom else. "Johnny" might be a sibling, friend, or cousin (other
relative). At the extreme end, most grandparents will not be skateboarding with
the child, so we can pretty much rule out some people.

3. If only "Family" is given, I would assume that's all members of the nuclear
family that are mentioned elsewhere in the TDs. I would also include other
relatives (grandparents) if they are there late at night and early in the
morning, and thus probably are HH members.

4. Sometimes you just have to make a good guess based on the information you
have. Just remember, the interviewer should have asked for clarification.

5. Sometimes the primary activities have H and I padded out. Personal care,
sleep, and so on. If someone is involved in one of these highly personal
activities as being around (col. I) then they are probably a close family
member (sibling or parent). This is information you can use, but it will not be
data entered as it automatically gets blanked out.

Socializing versus Talking. I would encourage you not to use the alizing codes
in the 7520, 7690, 7710, 7720, 7890, unless the activity is happening in a
social setting. I think this is one of those terms that people use for just
"talking" to other people.

Subject: getting ready for games

I've noticed a few things about our TD people with respect to playing in games
and preparing for it.

1. If someone is getting dressed/ready for a game, code it as 4090. That's our
standard "dressing" code.

2. If they are warming up on the field, or "stretching", or some other pre-game
activity, code as the appropriate sport. An example, football- 8011. This can
be a separate activity line also, if the diary is filled out that way.

Subject: the 5990 school travel code/ and 5970 and 5980

A few people have been having problems with this, so I'm going to explain it a

bit better.

1. 5990 gets used when there are two or more travel activity lines for getting

to or from school.

If R has one activity line "walking to the bus stop" and a second one "riding
the bus to school", those are both 5990.

2. 5990 gets used when there are "segments", or divisions, in the travel to and
from school. This could be to a friends house and then on to school.

5970 and 5980 get used when it's a direct shot to school (5970) or a direct
shot from school to home (5980). There should only be one activity line for
travel associated with these. They could also involve school buses to or from
R's home. This would be where the kid gets picked up or dropped of at their
home. The bus stop itself might or might not be on the child's home property,

and we do not have that level of information.

So the thing to key on is the number of activity lines to determine 5990, or

5970 and 5980.

One thing that might occur is that a timeline will need to be split if the
activity said. "walked to bus stop and rode bus to school. That is really two
activities, but it would be rare.

Do not re-code past cases. We'll catch these during data entry.

Subject: Travel time for doing Household activities at the other house,

I've seen 2 or 3 cases where the Child travels to another piece of real estate
that the HH owns to work on it (e.g. carpentry work).

In cases such as this, where a HH member owns the real estate, (or it's a new
home, or cottage), please use 3990 as the travel code, and the appropriate
household activity code (e.g. carpentry=1610, 1620, or 1640).

The 3990 travel code has this phrase in it, " travel related to obtaining goods
and services and/or household activities". It's the "household activities" that

means we can use this travel code for the 1000 activities.

This does run counter to our general rule that travel codes should align with
the activities, both having the same thousands number. Think of this as an
exception that is not going to occur very often.

Subject: multi-function electronic devices in the TDs

I just ran across a case, and coded it, where the kid is using something called
a Sony PSP. Basically it's a portable game console, but you can also listen to
music with it, play videos, and access the internet.

I would suggest we code this by the function of it that the R uses. This is how
I coded this Time Diary.

9290- for listening to music

8790- for playing videogames

5130- for the part of the code that mentions PDA. This is when the kid is
accessing the internet. The PSP apparently has a wireless card and can access
the internet through a home computer or network.

9190- if "watching videos or movies" had come up, but it did not.

Just to remind you that if there are missing dates, or empty date fields, on
the coversheet or page 16 of the Time Diaries, please leave those blank. You
can get through the cases in data entry, and they will be complete cases. Study
staff will get the dates from another source later, and take care of it.

Today, I went through all the cases that have been data entered, and I was
specifically looking at those date fields. I will be giving some of you back
cases that have missing date fields. Please go back into the cases and confirm
that they are blank. This will take about one minute per case.

So, to repeat, from this time forward it is okay to leave the date fields on
the coversheet and page 16 blank, if they are in the Diary.
