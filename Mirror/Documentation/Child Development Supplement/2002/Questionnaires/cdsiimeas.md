Children's body fatness changes over<br>the years as they grow. Also, girls and boys differ in their body fatness as<br>they mature. This is why BMI for children, also referred to as BMI-for-age, is<br>gender and age specific. BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth<br>charts. These charts are used for children and teens 2 – 20 years of age.

National norms for English-speaking and Spanish-<br>speaking respondents are available for these tests.<br>CDS-II used three subtests to measure reading and math skills (the Letter-<br>Word, Passage Comprehension, and Applied Problems tests). In CDS-I,<br>these tests were chosen due to the ease of administration as well as their<br>brevity, and then repeated in CDS-II. When applicable, the Spanish version<br>of the WJ-R (Batería-R, Form A),<br>was used for children whose primary language was Spanish.<br>A standardized score is provided for each of the three tests as well as a<br>combined “Broad Reading” score.|
