**FORWARD TO THE CIDLD DEVELOPMENT SUPPLEMENT-II**


Welcome to the Child Development Supplement-II. Staiiing in October 2002, this study will
collect infonnation from families with children who completed the 1997 Child Develo ment
Su lement and a 2001 Panel Stud of Income D ainics PSI interview.
D


- �- The Child Development Supplement is called a "supplement"
---. ---. **-** **-** .. **-**
because it utilizes the thi1iy-four years of data available from the PSID families to enhance its
objectives. At the same time, it stands on its own as a complete project that will obtain some of
the most comprehensive info1mation available about children.


Field Interviewers for this study will use general interviewing skills to conduct face-to-face
interviews with children and either face-to-face or telephone inte1views with their primaiy
caregivers. Additionally, Inte1viewers will leain to administer educational assessments to
children that accompany the face-to-face inte1view and to gather info1mation using time diaries.
Inte1viewers will also distribute self-administered questionnaires through the mail.


Much of the inte1viewing time during the household visit and telephone calls to each family will
be spent with the adults. But one of the unique aspects of this study is that Inte1viewers conduct
educational assessments and implement inte1views with up to two children in the household.
Inte1viewers who paiiicipated in the 1997 inte1views for the project repo1ied that they enjoyed
the child inte1views.


Many people have contributed their expe1iise and effo1i to the Child Development Study-II
including the Project Directors, Study Staff, Prograinming and Systems Staff, Field Managers
and the National Field Teain, and Smvey Managers. In particular, we would like to
acknowledge the pretest Inte1viewers who tested the study and the inte1viewing instruments in
the field with respondents. Their hai·d work, flexibility, and suggestions for improvement were a
vital pa1i of the development of the CDS-II.

**Overview of the**

**Child**

**Development**
**Supplement**



In the past several decades, there have been enormous demographic and
economic changes—some for better and some for worse—that have
altered the landscape for children and their families. Some of these
changes include: increased incidence of single-parent family structure,
declining social and economic conditions in many neighborhoods,
improvements in parental education, smaller family sizes, and increased
maternal employment. At the same time that such changes are taking
place, public policy targeting families and children, especially those at the
bottom of the economic ladder, has changed fundamentally as well. At
the time the CDS-I was fielded in 1997, the U.S. had very limited
nationally representative longitudinal studies of children focusing on
child health and development in the preadolescent years. The CDS-I was
designed to increase our knowledge about how these and other changes
are influencing child development and well-being,


To address such a gap in knowledge, the CDS set out to fulfill the
overarching objective of gathering comprehensive and nationally
representative information about children and their families to study how
social, economic, and other environmental factors affect children's and
adolescents’ development. The study addresses influences within the
context of families, schools, and neighborhoods, making it one of the
most comprehensive studies in the developmental field.


CDS is unique in the sense that it is a “supplement” to the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics. CDS combined with its parent study, the PSID,
provide opportunities to study the life course effects of circumstances and
experiences in childhood and adolescence on health, economic well
being, and other life dimensions in young adulthood and beyond.


The first wave of CDS was fielded in 1997 with funding from the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).


13


**Background**
**on PSID**



The study collected information on up to two randomly selected 0-12 year
old children of PSID families, resulting in a total sample of about 3,600
children in roughly 2,400 families.


The second wave of the CDS will be fielded in the fall of 2002 and spring
of 2003. The same children originally interviewed in CDS-I, now 5-18
years of age, will be re-interviewed. Much of the same information will
be collected from parents, teachers, and the children, as well as new data
addressing issues relevant to the adolescent stage.


Like CDS-I, the content domains in CDS-II are broad, covering many
topics in great detail. Later in this manual, we will briefly describe these
topics as we outline each of the instruments.


This project will fill an important gap in data on children by
supplementing a high quality, national sample that already contains 34
years of data on the families that it follows. Welcome to the CDS!


Now in its thirty-fourth year of data collection, the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of
U.S. men, women, children and the families in which they reside. Data
on employment, income, wealth, housing, food expenditures, transfer
income, and marital and fertility behavior have been collected annually
since 1968. From 5,000 families in 1968, the study has grown to include
over 10,000 families.


The study is conducted by the Survey Research Center (SRC), Institute
for Social Research (ISR), University of Michigan.


Over 1,100 researchers, journalists, and policy makers throughout the
United States and Europe use the data. Since 1968 over 600 journal
articles, 250 books and book chapters, and 350 government reports,
working papers, and dissertations have been based upon the PSID.

**Directors**


**Who Are the**

**Respondents?**



The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is
part of the National Institutes of Health, the biomedical research arm of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The mission of the NICHD
is to ensure that every person is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer
no harmful effects from the reproductive process, and that all children have
the chance to fulfill their potential for a healthy and productive life, free of
disease or disability. The NICHD was created by Congress in 1962, and it
supports and conducts research on topics related to the health of children,
adults, families, and populations.


The Project Directors for the CDS are Drs. Frank Stafford and Jacquelynne
Eccles.


**Dr. Frank P. Stafford** is the Principal Investigator of the CDS, Director of
the PSID, Senior Research Scientist at the Survey Research Center and
Professor in the Department of Economics. His research experience includes
comparative work with microdata studying labor supply, child care, and onthe-job training. His current research interests include household saving and
human capital formation, time use, international technology flows, and the
impact of monetary policy on household spending and portfolio adjustment.


**Dr. Jacquelynne S. Eccles**, Co-Director of the CDS, is the Wilbert
McKeachie Collegiate Professor of Psychology, Women’s Studies and
Education and Research Scientist at both the Research Center for Group
Dynamics in ISR and the Institute for Research on Women and Gender. She
has conducted research on topics ranging from gender-role socialization,
teacher expectancies, and classroom influences on student motivation to social
development in the family and school context. Her most recent work focuses
on the longitudinal study of the development and socialization of the
following types of psychological influences on motivation, activity choice and
involvement: self-perceptions of competence, task values and interests, life
goals, self-schema, motivational orientation, and mental health.


The respondents to the Child Development Supplement-II are families with
children age 18 and under who completed the 1997 Child Development
Supplement and a 2001 PSID interview. The following is a list of the types
of respondents you may find in each family. Please review carefully – it is
very important to understand the definition of the respondent types. There is
critical information here about Respondent Definitions and study preferences
for the identity of the primary caregiver and other caregiver (also please see
Appendix D for additional information on this topic).


**THE CHILD**
Up to two children, four to eighteen years old, per Family Unit are eligible for
inclusion in this study. Therefore, it is possible to have some children in a
household who are not eligible for inclusion in this study. Children have been
pre-selected for eligibility based on past participation in the 1997 CDS-I and
in the 2001 PSID interview.


15


**PRIMARY CAREGIVER (PCG)**
The Primary Caregiver is the main respondent for this study, and will be
completing the Coverscreen, signing permission forms, helping you schedule
interviews with the child, completing an interview about the child (the “PCGCHILD” instrument) and about the household environment (the “PCG-HH”
instrument), and in some cases, completing the time diaries for or with the
child. By definition, the PCG **must live with the child** .


In most cases, the **PCG** will be the **child’s biological mother** . If the
biological mother is not living with the child, the appropriate respondent is the
first person on the following list who lives with the child:


1. Stepmother, Adoptive mother, or Foster Mother
2. Other female **legal** guardian (Must be at least 18 years of age)
3. Father (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)
4. Male legal guardian of the target child
5. **Final preference** is to take the interview from the person living
with the child who is an adult (at least 18 years of age or older)
and takes primary responsibility for caring for the child. This
might be another relative such as a grandmother or aunt. This
does not include someone who is paid or hired to take care of the
child (i.e., not a babysitter or nanny).


We have preloaded the likely PCG based on data from CDS-I (1997) and the
2001 PSID core interview. It is important to verify who the PCG is because
that person may have changed since we interviewed the family last. Do not
make assumptions about the identity of the PCG – the Coverscreen will guide
you through the selection process.


If the primary caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the
Interviewer will administer separate sets of instruments for each child.


**OTHER CAREGIVER (OCG)**
The Other Caregiver is another adult in the household (usually the child's
father, or the mother's spouse/partner) who also has responsibility for raising
the child. Once you have determined who the actual PCG will be for this
study, you will ask the PCG if there is another caregiver in the household who
has responsibility for raising the child. There will be households that **do not**
have an OCG. By definition, the OCG **must live with the child** and **must be**
**at least 18 years of age** .


In most cases, the **OCG** will be the **child’s biological father** . If the
biological father is not living with the child, the appropriate respondent is the
first person on the following list who lives with the child (and is not the
PCG):


16


1. **Father** (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)
2. **Grandmother** of the target child
3. **Boyfriend or Girlfriend** of the primary caregiver
4. **Other Relative** of child who is an adult (over 18 years old) and
living in the HU. If there is more than one in the HU, choose the
person who has the most responsibility for taking care of the
target child.
5. **Other Non-relative** who is an adult (over 18 years old) and
living in the HU. If there is more than one in the HU, choose the
person who has the most responsibility for taking care of the
target child. This should not be a paid employee (i.e., not a
babysitter or nanny).


The Other Caregiver **must** be over 18 years of age for all definitions.


If the other caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the OCG will
fill out a separate questionnaire booklet for each child.


**TEACHER**
Each elementary school-age child’s teacher will be sent a self-administered
questionnaire. You will not need to contact the teacher yourself, but you will
need to obtain signed permission to contact the teacher from the primary
caregiver. For children in home school, the parent or household member who
teaches the child will be sent a teacher questionnaire to fill out.


**INTERVIEWER**
The Interviewer is also a respondent in this study. The Interviewer reports on
observations about the respondents and their interactions. These observations
are recorded in call notes and additional questions at the end of the
Interviewer administered questionnaires.

**PART B: OVERVIEW OF INTERVIEWER TASKS**


**General** This section is designed to orient the Field Interviewer to the process
involved in the Child Development Supplement. The large number of
components in this study makes it important to pay attention to the details
of setting up, administering, and completing the interviews. Below is a list
of procedures used in processing a household case and the preferred order
of administration. We understand that not all interviews can be completed
in this order; however, we have found that in general the interviews go
more smoothly when this order can be followed.



**Review Your**

**Sample**


**Pre-Contact**

**Letters**


**Contact the**

**Household**



Take the time to review the information on each sampleline and read the eprofiles for each case. This will help you decide the order in which to
contact your cases and the best approaches to use in each case. **Cases with**
**children age 5-11 should be contacted first.** We will be attempting to
contact the teachers of our elementary school age respondents and need to
complete these cases as early as possible to give the Project Staff enough
time to complete the Teacher Study.


You also need to prioritize your sample based on location. If you have two
samplelines close together, it makes sense to try and economize on travel
by scheduling them on the same day, if possible. You may also find a few
cases where you have two samplelines in the same household (cases where
families have moved in together). You would definitely want to schedule
these together, if at all possible.


You will receive pre-contact letters and brochures in your bulk materials.
You should mail the letters with the brochures to each household as you
work your sample. It is important to send out the letters in measured
quantities and intervals to provide sufficient sample to work efficiently
throughout the field period. The letters will remind respondents that their
family has participated in CDS in 1997 and ask for their participation again.
The letters will let respondents know that an Interviewer will be calling
them to make an appointment for a household visit to conduct the interview
with the primary caregiver and the CDS children. We hope that the precontact letters will smooth the way for the Interviewer's initial contact with
the household.


Once you have sent the pre-contact letter and allowed time for it to reach
the household, you are ready to contact the household. You will attempt to
reach and/or identify the primary caregiver to verify the household
members and study respondents. You will describe the details of what the
interview will involve and set up an appointment time for an in-person
interview. It is important to fully explain what will be expected of the
household. Explain the OCG questionnaire(s), time diaries, and how they
work. Tell the primary caregiver that you will be sending an Interview
Packet to the household, which will include an introduction letter, OCG
questionnaire(s), and time diaries.


18


**Send the CDS**

**Family an**
**Interview Packet**


**Organize**
**Materials**


**Visit the**

**Household**



After talking to the primary caregiver, send the Interview Packet, which
will include:


 - an introduction letter,

 - OCG questionnaire(s),

 - and time diaries.


You should fill in the respondent's names and appointment information on
the introduction letter before sending it to the household. You may do the
PCG interview by phone before you visit the household. If you decided to
do this, you should include a PCG Respondent Booklet in the Interview
Packet that you send to the household.


This step involves actually setting up the materials for the household. Your
bulk materials will include the questionnaires and materials you will need
to complete your household cases. You must determine what materials this
household will need and organize them. See the Interview Activities chart
in _Section 12: Administering the Overall Process_ to help you with this task;
this section also contains other details that will help you.


You will be provided with flexible expanding file folders in which to store
the materials for each case. Assemble all of the materials for each case and
keep it organized and safe in this file folder. You should take the file folder
with you to each household visit and have it close at hand whenever you
contact the household by telephone.


When you first arrive at the home, you will need to obtain written
permission from both the parent and children. There are several different
permission forms in your bulk materials – some are for the primary
caregiver to read and sign, and some for the children. _Section 3:_
_Permission Forms_ explains more about the permission forms. In general:


When you visit the household, you need to obtain a permission form signed
by the primary caregiver for each child **before** starting the Child CAPI
interview or assessments or attempting to contact the children themselves to
set an appointment. In addition, each child 8 years of age and older will be
asked to sign an interview assent form before they take part in the
assessments or CAPI interview.


For children age 5-11, you will attempt to obtain permission for the Project
Staff to contact the child(ren)'s teacher(s). This permission form also asks
for information about the child's school. For children age 12 and over, you
will ask only for information about the child's school so that Project Staff
can access public data about that school. In addition, for elementary
school-age (approximately 5-11 years old) children, you will attempt to
obtain permission for the project staff to contact the children's teacher.


While at the household, you will interview each selected child, and
interview the primary caregiver – if you have not by telephone already.

**Teacher or**

**School**

**Packets**



You may possibly interview the OCG if the OCG has not already filled out
the OCG Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ). Before leaving the
household, you will review the time diaries with the primary caregiver or
with the child, depending on who completed the instrument. In many
cases, it will be necessary to schedule a second household visit or phone
call to complete all the portions of the interview. Remember, it is
acceptable to interview the PCG later by phone.


When planning your contacts with a given household, be strategic. You will
want to be as efficient as possible so to reduce burden on both the
respondents and yourself. **Attempt to do as much with the primary**
**caregiver by telephone as you can.** Prioritize the activities that absolutely
need to be done in person for your household visit. There is more
information in _Section 12: Administering the Overall Process_ and _Section_
_13: Field Notes_ about tips and strategies for working through the various
components of the study.


If you obtained permission to contact the children's teachers and
information about the child's school, you will confirm the contact
information the primary caregiver gives you by comparing the information
to that given in the local phone book or on the Internet or driving by the
school if necessary (in case the school is not listed in a directory). Once
you have confirmed the information, two copies of the permission slip will
be included in the completed packet for that case that you mail to ISR along
with the other permission forms and paper questionnaires.


As soon as possible after a household visit, edit all the booklets, paper

questionnaires, and time diaries that have been completed thus far. Do not
wait until the entire case is complete; edit each portion as you finish it and
do the thumbnail sketches for each module as soon as possible. Complete
the Interviewer observations section in Blaise. Notify your team leader
that you have completed the household visit and report your progress with
the interview. Do keep all completed materials together in an envelope or
folder to make sure they do not get lost.


Once all of the components of the entire Child Development Supplement
household case have been completed, double-check them for completeness
and report to your Team Leader that you have finished the case. The
completed questionnaires and time diaries should be sent via UPS to Ann
Arbor in the UPS letter envelopes that are included in your bulk supplies.
Be sure to use the pre-printed labels that were sent with your supplies and
include the study name and your interviewer number.


Cases that will be evaluated should be sent via UPS to your Team Leader.
Make sure that you have noted in SurveyTrak that all portions have been
completed and mailed (see _Section 2: SurveyTrak, Blaise, and_
_Coverscreens_ for details about this task). Also enter the tracking number
for the package into SurveyTrak.

**PART A: SURVEYTRAK INSTRUCTIONS**


The SurveyTrak sample management system will guide all of our actions in
this study. SurveyTrak contains the household information, provides access
to the Blaise questionnaires, organizes administrative processes, and tracks
overall progress of our sample. It is vital that you understand how to use
SurveyTrak for this project and that you send and receive to transmit your
computer files to Ann Arbor every day.


You will be provided with a separate SurveyTrak manual that will explain in
detail specific SurveyTrak functions. If you are a new hire, your SurveyTrak
manual will be a part of your General Interviewer's Manual; otherwise, your
SurveyTrak manual will be under separate cover. Supplemental information
that is specific to CDS-II will be provided here.


Until you are familiar with all the pieces of the CDS interview, this section of
the manual may be somewhat confusing. However, we want to present this
information at the beginning because these technical systems are integrally
involved in every aspect of your work on this study. We recommend that you
read this portion of the manual and then refer back to it as you move through
the other sections and learn more about the different parts of the interview.
Also consult your SurveyTrak Manual for more information.


There are three CDS-II projects in SurveyTrak:


 - **Training Directory:** This contains the training sample lines that you will
use during in-person training. Additional lines for individual practice have
also been supplied in this project. You will be provided with a list of practice
IDs that are available for your use.


 - **Certification Directory:** This project contains lines that will be used to
conduct scripted certification interviews. Certification lines are not to be
used for any other purposes. After conducting your certification interview,
you will do a send/receive through SurveyTrak so the case can be properly
transmitted to Ann Arbor.


 - **Production Directory:** This contains your production sample. You will
use this project when you contact or attempt to contact a respondent for an
interview.


SurveyTrak operates at the household level for CDS-II. Each household will
have one sampleline that will allow you to access the interviews for all
relevant members of the household. All household level information will be
entered on this sampleline such as appointments, address updates, call
records, result codes, and item tracking.

**SurveyTrak**
**Main Screen**



The main display screen in SurveyTrak allows you to view your sample and
monitor the status of a given line. It displays all of the sample lines assigned
to you and specific data about each one. The columns in this main display
cannot be edited. They may contain information that was pre-loaded and/or
updated as you work the sample lines. You can change the order of columns,
freeze certain columns to always be displayed, or search and sort sample lines
by the order that will be most useful to you. Refer to your SurveyTrak
manual for details on searching, sorting and rearranging columns. A table
explaining each of the SurveyTrak main screen columns for CDS follows.


26


**SurveyTrak Main Screen Columns**

|Column|Purpose|
|---|---|
|RC IND|The refusal conversion indicator. If incremented, it means that the case, at<br>some point in time, was coded an initial refusal.|
|Sample ID|Provides a unique 7-digit identification number for each CDS household in<br>the format XXXX-XXX. The first four digits represent the PSID ID and the<br>last three digits are the unique household ID. (In addition, each family<br>member is assigned a 2-digit SEQ number that does not appear in the<br>SurveyTrak Sample ID column; for CDS children, this number is displayed<br>on their child interview tab in Blaise and should be written on paper<br>instruments).|
|Result Code|Displays the 4-digit result code currently assigned to the SID. See Appendix<br>G for a list of the 4-digit result codes for this study.|
|IW Status|Indicates whether the SID is complete, suspended, or not yet worked (blank).|
|Result Date|The date on which the most recent result code was assigned.|
|Tel Calls|Shows the number of telephone call contacts that the Interviewer has made to<br>the household.|
|Wizard Actions|Shows the status - blank (not yet worked), incomplete, or complete - of the<br>wizard actions in the Call Wizard.|
|Face-To-Face|Shows the number of face-to-face visit contacts that the Interviewer has made<br>to the household.|
|Last Call Mode|Indicates whether the most recent contact with the household was by<br>telephone or face-to-face.|
|Team?|Shows "Yes" if the HH is flagged for team interviewing; interviewers may<br>flag a household for team interviewing only after obtaining TL approval.|
|Language|Indicates the language in which the last PSID interview was done -<br>1=English, 2=Spanish, 7=Other.|
|Child 1 Status|Interview status of the Child 1 interview.|
|Age of Child 1|Age of Child 1 calculated from birth date as of October 1, 2002. Age will be<br>recalculated as of the current date and updated when you confirm the child's<br>birth date in the Coverscreen.|
|Child 2 Status|Interview status of the Child 2 interview.|
|Age of Child 2|Age of Child 2 calculated from birth date as of October 1, 2002. Age will be<br>recalculated as of the current date and updated when you confirm the child's<br>birth date in the Coverscreen.|
|PCG 1|Interview status of the PCG interview regarding Child 1.|
|PCG 2|Interview status of the PCG interview regarding Child 2 (if there is a second<br>CDS child).|

**Send/Receive**

**Daily**



It is very important for you to **send/receive daily** . Daily send/receive, or
transmission, regardless of whether your sample has been worked on a
given day, is critical for laptop maintenance. Important file sharing occurs
each time you transmit. Also, if you have worked sample in CDS, you
need to transmit your files in order for us to track the status of the project as
a whole. In addition, if a problem is identified with the programming of the
survey instrument, we can often automatically fix it when you conduct a
send/receive. For more information regarding send/receive, please review
your SurveyTrak manual.



**Call Wizard** The F10 function key in SurveyTrak provides you with access to the Call
Wizard. The Call Wizard is used to enter all your contact attempts,
regardless of whether you made contact or not. This is an efficient and
useful tool for keeping track of when you made your last call, whether
anybody was home, what kind of interaction you had with an informant or
respondent, and the result of the interaction. In essence, the Call Wizard
provides a history of the sample line. Every contact or attempt to contact a
respondent must be entered as a Call Record in SurveyTrak using F10 on
the appropriate sample line. When you Complete or Suspend an interview,
the Call Wizard will automatically bring up the Call Info screen.


**Result Codes** Appendix G provides you with interim and final result codes. Please
thoroughly review the codes and their definitions before beginning to
contact respondents. Production supervisors make critical decisions
throughout the data collection period based on the interim and final result
codes assigned to each sample line. It is important that calls and outcomes
are consistently coded the same across all cases, and as much as possible,
across all Interviewers. We trust you to understand the meaning and
definitions of the codes. If you are ever in doubt, review the code
definitions or discuss them with your Team Leader before assigning a code.



**Cost**

**Information**


**Information**

**Generated from**

**SurveyTrak**



At the end of each day you will **enter** **all of your cost information in the**

**Cost Information screen of the CDS Production Project.** Only
Production time and expenses are to be entered here. The data entered in
the screen should match your TEJ entry for the same date, **exactly.** For
more details about how to enter the cost information into SurveyTrak,
please review your SurveyTrak Manual.


Ninety percent of the data used in CDS reports comes from the information
you provide in SurveyTrak (the other 10 percent will be pulled from the
Blaise instrument). The reports are used for monitoring progress,
projecting outcomes that affect our response rate and costs, and
determining any intervention that may be necessary. We will be sharing
results of these special reports with CDS clients and staff members of the
funding agencies. We need to be sure results shown in the reports are
based on solid data. The information you enter in SurveyTrak is essential.
When you record data correctly and include all the information available,
we will be able to accurately interpret what is taking place in the field.

The View/Edit feature is different for CDS than for other studies because it has
additional tabs for each of the CDS children plus a tab for each child's PCG.
The individual tabs for each child and PCG in the household provide valuable
summaiy infonnation for you about the case that can be consulted quickly and
easily by pressing the View/Edit button.


These tabs also allow the Inte1viewer to enter different address infonnation for
each member of the fainily if necessai·y for incentive payment For most
families, the address infonnation for all the members will be the saine;
however, these tabs allow for household situations in which some members
have different addresses.


HH Mailing Address is the tab that contains the main address for the household.
When you contact the PCG, you will confom that the address infonnation in
this tab is conect and update it if necessaiy. This tab contains the address to
which the incentive payments for the children and the PCG will be mailed
unless they request to have their incentive mailed to a different address.

**Individual**

**Tabs**



Address Information


If any member of the household wants their incentive check to be sent to an
address that is different from the HH Mailing Address, then the address
information for that individual will need to be updated on the appropriate tab:
**Child 1 Address, Child 2 Address, PCG 1 Address,** or **PCG 2 Address.**


The PCG 1 Address tab contains the contact information for Child 1's PCG; the
PCG 2 Address tab contains the contact information for Child 2's PCG. For

most, but not all, households, Child 1 and Child 2 will have the same PCG.


The address information in the Child 1 Address, Child 2 Address, PCG 1
Address, and PCG 2 Address tabs will be blank unless you enter an address
indicating that the individual needs their check sent to a different address than is
listed in the HH Address tab. Information entered in these tabs will not alter the

address listed in the HH Address tab.


Child 1 Address and Child 2 Address Tabs


In addition to space for individual address information, the Child 1 Address and
Child 2 Address tabs contain the Sample ID number (plus 2-digit SEQ number),
the child's name, the names of the child's PCG and OCG, interview status, block
level R code (indicating the status of the child's Blaise interview), birth date,
and time diary days. This tab provides an easy way to check these crucial
pieces of information.


These tabs also include status bars for each of the paper forms that may be
required for the child: Parental Consent, Child Consent, Child Assessment,
Weekday Time Diary, Weekend Time Diary, OCG Interview, School Record
Information, and Teacher Permission Form.


The lower section of the Child tab contains three columns. The STATUS
column has a drop down menu that allows you to choose the result status of
each paper form for that child. It is very important that you update the
appropriate result status for each paper form on the Child 1 Address tab and the
Child 2 Address tab as necessary following each household contact. You will
not need every paper form for every child. The RECEIVED column will be
blank when you complete work on the case. After you send the paper forms to
Ann Arbor and they are logged, this column will show the date each item is
received and logged. The ITEM/FORM column shows the list of all possible
paper forms that may be required for each child.


The Child Assessment line also contains a drop down menu from which you
can choose "Pay by Check" or "Paid in Cash," depending on the method of
incentive payment for the child. The child should be paid the incentive when
the assessments are complete, so this menu will be available when you code the
Child Assessment line as complete. Doing so will trigger the payment process


30


for the child if you have not ah-eady paid him or her in cash.


PCG 1 Address and PCG 2 Address Tabs


The PCG 1 Address and PCG 2 Address tabs also contain the Sample ID
number (plus 2-digit SEQ number), the PCG's name, the child's name, inte1view
status, and block level R code (indicating the status of the PCG's Blaise
inte1view).

**Control Tab** The Control tab is used to track materials that you send to Ann Arbor or to your
Team Leader for evaluation. In the IW Taped field, indicate if you taped the
interview for evaluation. In the Tracking Number field, enter the shipping
tracking number of the package containing the interview tape that you are
sending for evaluation and/or the paper forms (whether you are sending them to
Ann Arbor or to your Team Leader for evaluation). In the Tape & Eval Mailed
and Forms Mailed fields, type the date that you mailed each of these items. The
information in the fields Rec'd by TL, Mailed to A2, and Rec'd by A2 will be
updated when your TL receives the items (if applicable), when your TL sends
them on to Ann Arbor (if applicable), and when the items are received and
logged in Ann Arbor. It is crucial that you fill out the Control tab when you are
sending tapes or paper forms to Ann Arbor or to your TL for evaluation. This
tab enables tracking of these items to ensure that they are not lost in transit.

**PART B: HOUSEHOLD COVERSCREEN**


**Respondent** Primary Caregiver



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Telephone/CAI



**Main Objective** The Household Coverscreen is used to record information obtained
during the initial contact with the household (usually by phone) where
the primary caregiver, other caregiver, and children are verified; the
interview procedure and mail-ahead materials are explained; and the
household session appointment time is set.


**Notes and Rules** The Coverscreen must be administered first before any other portions of
the interview are started, preferably during the initial contact with the
primary caregiver. The Coverscreen is used to obtain information that
determines the respondents as well as the structure and flow of all the
other portions of the interview.



**Key Objectives of**
**Questionnaire**



The Coverscreen contains, or is used to record, the following
information:


  - PCG, OCG and child(ren) name(s), birth dates, and relationships

  - Introductory script and questions to be read during the initial

contact

  - Explanation of the interview procedures

  - Directions for the time diaries and OCG questionnaire

  - The household session appointment time.


39


**DETAILS ON THE HOUSEHOLD COVERSCREEN QUESTIONS**


**Introduction** Introduce yourself and ask to speak to the person who is assumed,
based on information from previous PSID interviews, to be the PCG.
This person's name will be preloaded into the Coverscreen. Explain
that you are calling about the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child
Development Study and remind the PCG that the family has
participated in PSID and CDS in the past. What appears on the
introduction screen is a suggested phone introduction. You are not
required to read it verbatim. We strongly encourage all Interviewers to
tailor their introduction using the information provided during training
and in this reference manual. Use the information given in the Study
Fact Brochure to formulate an introduction with which you are
comfortable and successful.

**Statement of** Inform the PCG that the interview is voluntary and that his or her answers
**Confidentiality** will be kept confidential.



**Child Roster**

**Verification**



SurveyTrak will have preloaded the names of children we expect to be in
the household based on previous interviews for PSID and CDS. However,
you will need to confirm that each child is still living in the household. If
a child on this list has moved away from the household, the Coverscreen
will guide you through the appropriate questions to ask and the subsequent
path to follow, depending on why the child has moved away. These
questions and path will be based on the rules described below.



**Move Out Rules** If you learn during the child roster verification that a child on the list has
moved away from the household, you will ask for the reason why that
child has moved away. We have identified ten expected reasons why a
child may no longer be living in the household; in addition, there is an
Other (Specify) answer option for responses that do not fit the pre-defined
categories. Depending on the reason why the child has moved away, you
will either get the child's new contact information including their new
PCG and call the new household or you will code the child out.

If there is more than one CDS child in the household unit, and one of the
children has moved out but the other one has stayed, the rules above apply
with some additional procedures. Based on the Move Out Reasons given
above, if the child who has moved out should be interviewed (rather than
coded out), SurveyTrak will spawn a new sampleline for the child who
has moved out while keeping the other child on the original sampleline.
You will subsequently treat the two children as belonging to two separate
households. If the child who has moved out should be coded out,
SurveyTrak will create the blocks for that child's interview and the PCG
interview regarding that child in the original sampleline as usual; you
should code out those blocks appropriately and conduct the interviews
with the other child and PCG in that household.


If there is more than one CDS child in the household unit, and both of the
children have moved out, you will ask if both of the children are now
living together in the same household. If the answer is YES, you will
update the contact and target PCG information for the case and call the
new household to complete the interview. If the answer is NO, meaning
the children are living in separate households now, you will obtain
separate updated contact and target PCG information for each child. Child
1 will remain with the current sampleline, and SurveyTrak will create a
new sampleline for Child 2. In addition, the rules in the Move Out


41


**Child Information**

**Update**

Reasons table apply when determining whether to interview or to code out
each of the children.


If a child has moved out, especially if they have entered the military or
gone to college, it is crucial that you do everything you can to obtain their
new contact information from the PCG. Project staff will attempt to
contact these children and ask them to complete self-administered
questionnaires. If the PCG is reluctant to give you the child's contact
information, explain that it is important to include their children's
experiences in the study, even if they have already moved out and gone on
to college or entered the military.


This screen will display preloaded information about each child in the
household including name, gender, and date of birth. Confirm the spelling
of the name and the other information with the PCG. Child information
will be updated for each CDS child living in the household.


For most households, the person who was preloaded as the primary
caregiver will still be the primary caregiver. In this case, just confirm that
the person with whom you are speaking is in fact the person living with
the child who has primary responsibility for taking care of the child. Also
confirm the relationship of the PCG to the child (mother, father,
grandmother, etc.).


If the person who was preloaded as the primary caregiver tells you that
another person is the actual primary caregiver, designate that person as the
actual PCG in place of the preloaded PCG. If the actual PCG is already
listed as a member of the household in the household listing grid displayed
on this screen, simply flag that person as the new PCG and confirm that
person's name and relationship to the child. If the actual PCG is **not** listed
on the household listing grid, enter the name, gender, and relationship to
the child of the actual PCG at this screen. (In this case, you will ask the
preloaded PCG to name the actual PCG, but you may need to assist in
determining who should be the actual PCG. See Appendix D for
guidelines in making this decision.) Then ask to speak to the actual PCG,
introduce yourself and the study, and continue with the Coverscreen
questions.


Verify the primary caregiver for each CDS child living in the household.
It is possible that there will be two CDS children in the same household
who each have a different PCG.


Ask the primary caregiver if there is another person, age 18 or older,
living with the child who helps take care of the child. If the answer is
"yes," ask the other caregiver's name and either flag that person as the
OCG if their name appears on the OCG grid or enter that person's
information in the grid. You may need to help the PCG determine who
should be designated as the OCG; see Appendix D for guidelines.


42


Confirm the OCG's name and relationship to the child for each child.


**Incentive Payment** After you have verified who the primary caregiver and other caregiver are,

you will begin the process of explaining the interview and setting up the
interview. We have found that it is usually most effective to mention the
incentive payment at this time, but it is acceptable to mention the payment
earlier in the introduction if the respondent is expressing reluctance and
you feel payment would make them more willing to continue.


For CDS-II, the PCG will be sent an incentive check of $75 upon
completion of his or her interview, and each child will be sent a check for
$20 when he or she completes his or her assessments.


**Time Diary** You will need to explain to the PCG that you will be sending two time
diaries for the PCG and/or the child to fill out for each CDS child prior to
the household visit. Since the time diary is a very important part of this
study, it is essential that you introduce the diary in a way that encourages
the primary caregiver to fill the diaries out completely and carefully. Use
the script on this screen as a guide, and come up with an explanation that
you feel comfortable with and that motivates your respondents to do as
good a job as possible with the diaries.


Blaise will randomly assign a weekday and a weekend day for the time
diaries. If there is more than one child in the household, the time diaries
will need to be filled out on the same days for all children. Note the days
of the interview, weekday diary, and weekend day diary. If the child is 12
or over, you should ask the PCG to have the child do the time diaries.



**Set Appointment**
**Time**



There are several things to keep in mind when setting up the appointment.


  - Try to set an appointment time when the primary caregiver and
(all) child(ren) will be home so you can do the interview in one
visit if possible.

  - Tell the respondent about how long the interview will take, to
make sure that you have sufficient time to do the interview during
the visit.

  - Make sure the respondent understands that you will be
interviewing (him/her) and the child(ren) selected for the study.
Also make sure they understand that you will be sending Time
Diaries and questionnaires for the Other Caregiver that should be
filled out before you come for the interview appointment.

  - Decide if you will interview the family with another Interviewer or

not.


43


**Mail Interview**

**Packet**



Remind the PCG that you will be mailing an Interview Packet to the
household containing an introductory letter, the time diaries and the OCG
questionnaire. Verify and update the PCG's address in SurveyTrak. After
you have set up the appointment, mail the Interview Packet to the PCG.



**Call Records** Every contact attempt should be recorded in the call records. Because you
will be working with different households at one time and it may take
several contacts to set up and complete a household case, good call notes
will be essential for this study.


Include in your call notes a brief description of the contact with the
household, including any unusual circumstances that you should keep in
mind for the household visit or that a future Interviewer might wish to be
aware of.  You should add another call note after each contact with the
household, especially after your home visit.


Notes about unusual custody arrangements, suggestions for best times to
make contact, notes about the extracurricular activities of the child(ren), or
other helpful hints to the next Interviewer should be included here.


Notes about unusual situations that might affect the data in the
questionnaires should be included in the notes for each questionnaire,
which will be reviewed by the coding staff prior to coding the data for
each questionnaire.

**Questionnaire**
**Layout**



**PART C: BLAISE INSTRUCTIONS**


Blaise uses preloaded information about the household members plus
updates provided by the Interviewer in the Coverscreen to set up the
appropriate number and types of questionnaires for the whole household.
These different questionnaires are called blocks and appear in Blaise side
by side designated by tabs at the top of the screen. The tabs may be
accessed in any order (with a few exceptions) providing you with the
flexibility to complete the different parts of the interview in the most
convenient way for each household.


Basically, each tab within the Blaise application is an individual interview.
When you begin a case, all that will be available to you will be the
Coverscreen tab. Once the Coverscreen is completed, Blaise will create
the appropriate PCG and Child tabs based on the data from the
Coverscreen.


The tabs in a typical household with two CDS children will include Child
1, Child 2, PCG Child 1, PCG Child 2, PCG HH 1, PCG HH 2 and the
observations tabs. The children's names will be included in the tab names
rather than the numbers; for example, Child Jane and PCG Jane.


In addition, each household will have a tab labeled Block Codes that
contains information on interim result codes for each interview block. You
will use the Block Codes tab to assign an interim result code to a block if
you need to suspend that block or the whole interview before it is
complete.


Listed below is a step-by-step description of the process for moving
between tabs as needed during the course of completing all the interviews
required for the household:


  - Select the household to interview from the SurveyTrak sampleline
screen (see the Step-by-Step Guide to SurveyTrak for CDS-II in
this chapter for details on this step).


  - Complete the Coverscreen for the case (see the Coverscreen section
of this chapter for details on this step).


  - Upon completion of the Coverscreen, Blaise will create the Block
Status tab located on the forefront of your screen. At first, before
you have started any of the interview blocks, all the blocks that will
be used for this household will be listed as "Not Yet Started." Any
blocks that are not appropriate for this household are listed as "Not
Selected" (for example, if there is only one CDS child in the
household, the Child 2 and PCG 2 blocks will be listed as "Not
Selected.")


45


**Interviewer**

**Observations**


**Special**
**Circumstances**




  - You will also see the tabs at the top of the screen for the PCG and
Child interviews that need to be done for this case. Press CTRL-S
to bring up the pop-up menu that will allow you to select the block
that you want to start with. Use your arrow keys to move through
this menu, then press ENTER to select a block to interview.


  - As you complete each block, you will be routed back to the Block
Status tab and you will use CTRL-S to access the menu and select
the next block to do. When all blocks for the case are completed,
you can enter 1 on the Block Status tab to complete the case. If you
enter a 1 and there are unfinished blocks, you will get an error

message.


Blaise also includes another set of parallel blocks containing the
Interviewer Observations.


There are two sets of Interviewer Observations questions:


  - The first set of questions is about your observations of the PCG's
interactions with each CDS child. These blocks will be labeled

**PCG OBS 1** and **PCG OBS 2** .


  - The second set of questions is about the household in general and
should only be completed once for each household; it is labeled **HH**
**OBS** .


Blaise will create the appropriate number of Interviewer Observations
blocks for each household after the Coverscreen is complete.


You should complete the Interviewer Observations as soon after the
household visit as possible while the visit is still fresh in your mind.
However, you should not do the observations in the presence of any of the
respondents.


The case will not be coded complete until all Interviewer Observations
have been finished.


  - If you need to suspend the case during the Coverscreen: use ALTX as you normally would.


  - If you need to suspend during one of the blocks: use CTRL-S to
bring up the pop-up menu and select the Block Codes option. Enter
the appropriate result code for the block you wish to suspend from
the abbreviated list on the screen. Then use ALT-X to suspend
Blaise. When you come back into the case, use CTRL-S to bring
up the menu and select the block to finish - you will need to press
the END key to go the question you were on when you suspended.


46


- If you need to suspend a block in order to move to another block for example, if you are interviewing a PCG and a very hard to reach
child suddenly becomes available - suspend the PCG block by
pressing CTRL-S to bring up the pop-up menu and select the Block
Codes option. Enter the appropriate result code for the PCG block.
Then, press CTRL-S again to bring up the menu and select the
appropriate Child block for the interview you wish to begin. When
the Child block is done, you can use CTRL-S to return to the
unfinished PCG block and complete it.


- If you have a refusal or other non-interview on a block, you will
need to go to the Block Codes screen to enter that result. Cases can
be considered complete with refused Child blocks, but all PCG
blocks must be complete for a case to be coded complete.


- You will only need to use the Block Codes screen to note result
codes for suspended or refused blocks. Completed blocks are
coded automatically.

**PART A: INFORMED CONSENT OVERVIEW**



**Introduction to**

**Informed Consent**

**Procedures**



Because we are working with children in this study, it is mandatory that we
receive written permission from the primary caregiver in the study to
interview each child. In addition to written permission from the primary
caregiver, children aged 8 years and older must give written permission for
their own interview.


The purpose of the interview is to look at all aspects of the child's life,
including their school experiences. For this reason, for all children in the
study, you will ask the parents for information about the child's school.
For elementary school-aged children (age 5-11 years only), you will ask
the primary caregiver for permission for the project staff to contact the
child’s teacher and request that the teacher complete a short selfadministered questionnaire. The questionnaire asks questions about the
child’s performance and behavior at school, some questions about the
classroom and school environment, and some background information
about the teacher him/herself.


For children who are middle and high school-aged (12 years and older),
you will ask the primary caregiver for school name and address, and other
school information on the School Information Form. The project staff will
be utilizing public data from the U.S. Department of Education to learn
more about resources in the school, such as number of teachers, funding
information, and so on. For the Teacher Permission and School
Information forms, it is critical that you confirm the contact information to
ensure that it is correct before sending it on to the Ann Arbor office.


Obtaining permission should be the first activity you do upon arriving in
the household. Make sure you attempt to get all the necessary permission
forms signed for the household. Also be certain that you only conduct
interviews with children when you have already obtained the required
written permission from the PCG and the child.


Each permission form is a three-ply NCR form. Once the primary
caregiver and child have reviewed and signed the forms, you will give the
primary caregiver a copy of each form (the bottom pink copy). The other
copies of the completed permission forms must be returned to the Ann
Arbor office and kept on file (the top two white and yellow copies).


Following the household visit in which you obtain signed permission
forms, be sure to record their completion in the View/Edit tab in
SurveyTrak (see _Section 2: SurveyTrak, Blaise, and Coverscreens_ for
details). Similarly, once you mail the permission forms and all other
materials back to Ann Arbor, record this information in SurveyTrak as
well.

**PART B: PARENT/GUARDIAN PERMISSION FORMS**


**Respondent** PCG



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Face to Face (ONLY)
Do NOT mail the permission forms with the Interview Packet. Take
them with you to the household visit.



**Main Objective** To obtain permission from the PCG to interview the child.


**Notes and Rules** You **must** obtain permission from the PCG in order to conduct the
interview with the child. If the PCG refuses to sign the permission
form, attempt to interview the PCG and OCG about that child without
interviewing the child. In other words, try to complete the PCG-Child
and PCG-HH Blaise modules, time diaries, and OCG SAQ. You should
use your refusal aversion and conversion skills as appropriate to attempt
to secure permission to interview the child.


There are separate Parent/Guardian Permission Forms for children ages
5-11 and for children ages 12 years and older. The Parent/Guardian
Permission Form for children ages 12 years and older advises parents
that the child interview includes questions of a sensitive nature. Be
certain to have the PCG sign the permission form appropriate for the
age of each child. The PCG must sign a separate permission form for
each CDS child in the household.


The Parent/Guardian Permission Form is a three-ply NCR form. The
top two copies (white and yellow) are to be sent in for the records in
Ann Arbor and the bottom copy (pink) is to be left with the primary
caregiver.



**If Permission is**

**Denied**



Even if we cannot get a signed parental permission form and, therefore,

cannot interview the child, we will still be able to include the household
in the study. That is, you should still attempt to conduct the PCG-Child
and PCG-HH modules, and collect time diary data and OCG
questionnaires. Information from the child, however, is a fundamental
part of this study, so it is important to be as persuasive as possible.
Stress to the respondent the importance of the study and remain positive
in your introduction.

TOC


**PART C: CHILD INTERVIEW ASSENT FORMS**


**Respondent** Children ages 8 years and older



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Face to Face (ONLY)



**Main Objective** To obtain assent from the child to be interviewed if the child is aged 8
years or older.


**Notes and Rules** You **must** also obtain written assent from the child if he or she is aged 8
years or older in order to conduct the interview with the child. If the
child refuses to sign the Interview Assent Form, attempt to interview the
PCG and OCG about that child without interviewing the child. You
should use your refusal aversion and conversion skills as appropriate to
attempt to secure the child's assent to be interviewed.


There are separate Interview Assent Forms for children aged 8-11 years
and adolescents aged 12 and up. The Interview Assent Form for
respondents 12 and up advises them that the interview will contain
questions of a sensitive nature. Be certain to have the child sign the
Interview Assent Form appropriate for his or her age. Each CDS child
ages 8 and older in the household must sign his or her own Interview
Assent Form.


Children under 8 years of age do not sign an interview assent form
because these younger children cannot understand the forms and the
assent process. Permission to interview children under 8 years of age is
obtained only from the PCG.


The Interview Assent Form is a three-ply NCR form. The top two
copies (white and yellow) are to be sent in for the records in Ann Arbor
and the bottom copy (pink) is to be left with the primary caregiver.

**PART D: TEACHER PERMISSION FORM**


**Respondent** PCG



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Face to Face (ONLY)



**Main Objective** To obtain permission from the PCG to contact the child's teacher for
children aged 5-11 years.


**Notes and Rules** For elementary school-aged (5-11 years old) children, you will attempt
to obtain permission from the PCG for the project staff to contact the
child’s teacher. The teacher will be asked to fill out a self-administered
questionnaire about the child.


Complete all information on the form. Ask the PCG for the teacher's
contact information including the teacher's first and last name, school
address, and school phone number. Confirm the contact information the
primary caregiver gives you by comparing the information to listings in
the local phone book or on the Internet. If necessary, drive by the
school address to confirm the proper name of the school and address
information.


If the child does not have one main teacher (for example, if the child is
11, in middle school, and changes classes), please note that on the top
part of the form. You should still collect the school information.


If the child is home schooled, enter the parent's or other home school
instructor's name, address and phone number as the teacher contact
information on the Teacher Permission Form. The parent must still sign
the Teacher Permission Form even if he or she is also the child's

teacher. Make a note that the child is home-schooled on the form.


The Teacher Permission Form is a three-ply NCR form. The top two
copies (white and yellow) are sent to Ann Arbor. The bottom copy
(pink) is left with the primary caregiver.



**If Permission is**

**Denied**



If a primary caregiver is reluctant to sign the permission form, try gentle
persuasion by explaining how important this study is. It is important
that the PCG fills out all parts of the permission form. We will be
contacting the teacher by mail from the Ann Arbor office to ask him or
her to fill out a questionnaire about the child. If we do not receive the
completed questionnaire from the teacher, we will be following up by
phone. In order to contact the teacher accurately, we need full
information from the PCG.

**PART E: SCHOOL INFORMATION FORM**


**Respondent** PCG



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Face to Face (ONLY)



**Main Objective** To obtain information about the school from the PCG for adolescents
aged 12 years and older.


**Notes and Rules** You will attempt to obtain school information from the PCG for
adolescents aged 12 years and older. These data include the name of the
principal, the name of the school and school district, and the school
address. Project staff will use this information to access public data
about the school available from the U.S. Department of Education.


You will need to confirm the contact information the primary caregiver
gives you by verifying the information in the local phone book or on the
Internet, or if necessary, by driving by the school.


The School Information Form is a three-ply NCR form. The top two
copies (white and yellow) are sent to Ann Arbor. The bottom copy
(pink) is left with the primary caregiver.



**If Permission is**

**Denied**



If a primary caregiver is reluctant to fill out the information form, try
gentle persuasion by explaining how important this study is. It is

**SECTION 4: OVERVIEW OF THE INSTRUMENTS**


57


**The “Big Picture”**
**of the CDS**

**Instruments**



**THE CDS INSTRUMENTS**


There are several data collection instruments in the CDS-II that you will
administer to the children and their caregivers. In this section, we will
give you a summary of these instruments, and then follow up in the next
sections with more detailed explanation of the content and objectives of
each instrument, specific administration protocols, and question-byquestion objectives.


The main instruments of the CDS are:


(1) Primary Caregiver Child CAPI Interview that focuses on the primary

caregiver’s report of child’s health, schooling, family and social
environment;
(2) Primary Caregiver Household CAPI Interview that focuses on

household characteristics and the primary caregiver’s own
psychological resources, parenting attitudes, and social support;
(3) Interviewer Observations in which the interviewer records observed

interactions between the primary caregiver and the child/adolescent,
and characteristics of the physical environment of the home and
neighborhood;
(4) Child CAPI Interview for children aged 8 years and older, which

queries the children themselves about school, health, and social
environment;
(5) Child Interview Audio-Computer Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI)

component of the Child-CAPI instrument for sensitive topics asked of
adolescents;
(6) Assessments, including height and weight measurements for all

children and standardized educational achievement tests for all
children using the Woodcock-Johnson and WISC Digit Span Test;
(7) Time Diary for weekday and weekend accounts of children’s and

adolescents’ time use, filled out by the child/adolescent alone or in
collaboration with the primary caregiver;
(8) Other Caregiver Questionnaire, a self-administered booklet that focuses

on the child/adolescent and household characteristics completed by the
secondary caregiver in the home.


The table on the next page is a schematic description of the instruments.
The sections that follow will provide more details for each instrument. For
the CAPI instruments, on-line question-level help will also be available
within the Blaise interviews. Since the on-line help serves the role of
providing immediate assistance during the interview, it does not contain all
of the details described in the following chapters. Please carefully review
the objectives listed in this manual in order to fully understand the overall
questionnaire goals and the specific objectives of the question items.

**Section C:**

**Child Care**

**Arrangements**


**Section D:**

**Absent Parents**


**Section E:**

**Family Activities**


**Sections F/G/H:**

**Child Hobbies**

**and Activities**



In Section A, we ask the primary caregiver a detailed series of questions
about the child’s/adolescent’s health, including hospitalizations, chronic
conditions, asthma, health care utilization, and health care coverage.


In Section B, we ask a number of questions about the child’s/adolescent’s
school enrollment and primary caregiver’s expectations about the
child’s/adolescent’s schooling. We are also interested in grade level, type
of school (private/public), frequency of school changes, school tuition,
attendance, receipt of meals under the school lunch and breakfast
programs, attendance at special class or school for gifted students, or
whether was classified as needing special education.


We also ask the primary caregivers about their involvement in the child's
school, including meeting or conversing with the child's/adolescent’s
teacher, school principal, or school counselor; attendance at a school event
or the parent-teacher's association meeting; and volunteer work in the
classroom.


In the Child Care Section, we inquire about the type, frequency of use, and
costs of all formal and informal arrangements.


We have a series of questions in Section D that focus on the
child’s/adolescent’s interaction with an absent parent, including the
frequency and types of activities in which absent parents are involved with
their children.


We also ask about the degree of conflict and/or agreement between the
parent the child lives with and the absent parent over issues such as where
the child lives, how he/she is raised, visits, discipline, etc.


Section E contains questions about family activities, such as frequency of
parents engaging in indoor and outdoor activities with child or adolescent,
family get-togethers, and eating meals together.


Sections F, G, and H are all about hobbies, after-school activities, and
community activities. The sections are divided according to age of the
child. There are questions about young children – under 8 years – in
Section F; questions about children aged 8-9 in Section G; and questions
about youth aged 10 years and older in Section H.


At the end of H are a series of questions about expenditures and savings.
You will ask these questions regarding all children/adolescents in the
study. The CAPI instrument will path you accordingly.

|PART C: QUE|ESTION-BY-QUESTION OBJECTIVES FOR THE PCG- CHILD CAPI INSTRUMENT|
|---|---|
|**QUESTION**|**QUESTION OBJECTIVE**|
|**A3**|We want the number of different times the child stayed overnight in the<br>hospitalfor in-patient care, not counting the hospital stay when the child<br>was born. At A3, we are not concerned about the number of reasons for<br>hospital stays, but rather actual stays. If the child was in the hospital more<br>than once for the same illness – that counts as multiple hospital stays.|
|**A3b**|If there is any doubt, please ask R to spell the name of the condition or<br>illness for which the child was hospitalized.|
|**A4a-q**|Onlymark ‘yes’ for conditions diagnosed by a doctor or health<br>professional.<br>A health professional includes nurse, physician’s assistant, nurse<br>practitioner, social worker, or counselor. If R volunteers that the child has<br>a condition (e.g., asthma) but says it has not been diagnosed by a doctor or<br>health professional, check ‘no’ and make an “F2 comment.”|
|**A4m**|If R says that the child has Autism or ADHD, record “no” at A4m. Those<br>problems should be coded in A4n or A4o. A4m isonlyfor learning<br>disabilities other than those listed in the A4 series.<br>If (for example) ‘Autism’ is volunteered at A4m, probe for other learning<br>disabilities at A4m, and mark A4n as ‘yes’ without asking the question.|
|**A4o**|ADHD is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; and ADD is Attention<br>Deficit Disorder.|
|**A4q1**|Ask the R to spell the name of the disability, and try to get the full name<br>rather than an abbreviation or acronym.|
|**A5**|This question refers only to physical illness. Injury and emotional<br>problems are covered in later questions. Note that the frame of reference<br>for this question is the last 12 months.<br>‘Other health professional’ includes physician’s assistant, nurse<br>practitioner, etc.|
|**A5b**|If there is any doubt, ask R to spell the name of the illness. If the child was<br>seen for multiple illnesses at that time, record all of them.|

|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
|**A6**|This question refers only to injury (e.g., broken leg, wound, burn).<br>Physical illness and emotional problems are covered in other questions.<br>Note that the frame of reference for this question is the last 12 months.<br>‘Other health professional’ includes physician’s assistant, nurse<br>practitioner, etc.|
|**A6b**|We want the specific injury or injuries for which the child was seen (e.g.,<br>‘broken arm’), not the cause of the injury (‘fell off a swing’).|

|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
|**C3a1**|Definitions of the care arrangements are critical to understand:<br>Relative under 13 in the child’s home: This will generally be regular care<br>by the child’s brother or sister under age 13.<br>Relative 13 or older in the child’s home: This includes care by an older<br>brother or sister, a grandmother, or any other relative. Do not include the<br>child’s parents. We will know about their care from the time diary.<br>Nonrelative in the child’s home: This is regular care provided by someone<br>not related to the child in the child’s home. This will usually be a sitter;<br>however, it includes care by a nanny or au pair. The age of the nonrelative<br>does not matter here. It includes a teen babysitter, for example, if the care<br>occurs on a regular basis.<br>Care in a relative’s home: The child is related to the caregiver and the care<br>takes place in the relative’s home.<br>Care in a nonrelative’s home: This is often called family day care. Family<br>day care is care provided for a small group of children in the caregiver’s<br>home. Often a family day care provider is a mother with children of her<br>own at home. The caregiver may be a friend, a neighbor, or the woman<br>down the street that cares for children. The crucial factor is that the<br>caregiver is not related to the child and the care is in the caregiver’s home.<br>Head Start Program: Head Start is the foremost early childhood program<br>for low-income children and their families. It consists of a preschool or<br>nursery school program for groups of children and their teachers. It also<br>includes social and health services. As with other preschool programs, it<br>occurs in a center-based environment. Parents whose children are in Head<br>Start will know it. If the parent is not sure of the program’s name, it is<br>probably not Head Start. There are a variety of other programs in<br>operation with similar names that may include a preschool program for<br>children. If they include center-based care for children, include it under<br>‘Pre-Kindergarten program, nursery school, preschool, or child care<br>center;’ or ‘Before or after school program;’ depending on whether the<br>child is enrolled in school or not.<br>Pre-Kindergarten program, nursery school, preschool, or childcare center: <br>These are all establishments where children are cared for in a group in a<br>nonresidential setting for all or part of the day. All provide some form of<br>educational program as well as play and recreational activities for young<br>children. If the child is school age, please code the care under ‘Before or<br>after school program.’|

|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
||Before or after-school program: Many centers have developed programs<br>specifically for school-age children and many schools also provide such<br>programs. They may be in the school building or in a separate building<br>with transportation from one to the other. A before-school program is a<br>special program that children attend before their official school day begins.<br>An after-school program is a program that children attend after their<br>official school day ends until their parents are able to pick them up after<br>work. If a child is in a before or after-school program in a private home,<br>please code that under the appropriate category for home-based care, either<br>relative or nonrelative, in the child’s or the caregiver’s home.<br>Child cares for self alone: In some cases parents leave children to care for<br>themselves for periods between the end of the school day and the parent's<br>arrival after work. If the child is truly alone with no adult and no older<br>sibling, the child is caring for himself. If the child has an older sibling<br>there, it would be ‘Care by a relative under age 13’ or ‘Care by a relative<br>over age 13.’ If the child is caring for a younger sibling, this child is<br>caring for himself and the younger sibling is being cared for by a relative<br>over or under age 13 in the child’s home.<br>Other type of childcare: Please write out what the parent says if it does not<br>appear to fit into any of the above categories.<br>None: If a child is only cared for occasionally but not regularly, by<br>someone other than the parent, please code ‘none.’|
|**C4a; C4b**|Be as specific as possible. For example, try to get the child’s age in both<br>years and months (e.g., 2 years and 5 months) if possible. This example<br>would be recorded as “29” at C4a and “months” at C4b.|

**PART D: SECTION OVERVIEW FOR THE PCG-HH CAPI INSTRUMENT**


**PCG-HH Module** The PCG-HH module is asked once for each child’s/adolescent’s
immediate family situation. If there are two CDS children/adolescents
with the same primary caregiver, you will need to administer the PCG-HH
module only once.


The PCG-HH module focuses on the social environment of the child.
Starting at the broadest level, we ask a number of questions about the
neighborhood, such as length of time lived in the neighborhood,
neighborhood satisfaction, perceptions of safety, and social cohesion. We
also ask about the family’s participation in the community or
neighborhood, such as participation in church, community institutions like
the YMCA, scouting, and neighborhood organizations.


We are interested in knowing a little bit about the family environment as
well. We ask about the distribution of household responsibilities among
household members, life style adjustments parents sometimes make to
improve their children’s lives, experiences of economic or financial stress
and strain and practical responses to such financial pressures, and media
use and household rules about use of such media as TVs, computers, and

games.


Finally, we want to know a little bit about the primary caregivers
themselves. For example, we ask about attitudes towards the father role,
maternal work, and non-parental childcare; self-esteem; psychological
distress; work schedules, and social support.

**PART A: SUMMARY NOTES FOR INTERVIEWER OBSERVATIONS**

**INSTRUMENT**


**Respondent** Interviewer


**Color** Blaise module



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Blaise/self



**Main Objective** To record observed interactions between the primary caregiver and
child/adolescent, and characteristics of the physical environment of the
home and neighborhood.


**Notes and Rules** This interviewer observation section should be completed as soon as
possible after you leave the household, while the interview is still fresh in
your mind.


You should answer the questions for observations seen during the whole
time you were in the home and not just during the interview itself. If there
are unusual situations, you may want to jot some notes down while you are
still in the household to help you fill out this section completely.


Be as objective as possible. When recording responses to items in this
module, think back on observable events, and try not to be influenced by
your own values or preconceived assumptions. Use the question-byquestion objectives on the following pages to help you record as precise
responses as possible.


There are two sets of Interviewer Observations questions. The first set of
questions is about your observations of the PCG's interactions with each
CDS child. This includes questions K1-K26 and will be completed once
for each CDS child in the household. These blocks will be labeled **PCG**
**OBS 1** and **PCG OBS 2** in Blaise.  The second set of questions is about
the household in general and should only be completed once for each
household; it includes questions K27-K39 and is labeled **HH OBS** in
Blaise.



**Key Objectives of**
**the Instrument**



The items in the Interviewer Observations module are used as one measure
of the cognitive stimulation and emotional support parents provide to
children.

**PART B: QUESTION-BY-QUESTION OBJECTIVES FOR THE**

|PART B: Q|QUESTION-BY-QUESTION OBJECTIVES FOR THE INTERVIEWER OBSERVATIONS|
|---|---|
|**QUESTION**|**QUESTION OBJECTIVE**|
|**K1**|A PCG’s speech is ‘distinct, clear, and audible’ if you are able to<br>understand what the adult says and communicate with him/her.|
|**K2**|A PCG may not readily understand your questions due to language<br>barriers, comprehension difficulties, hearing problems, etc.|
|**K3**|‘Expressing ideas freely and uses statements of appropriate length’ refers<br>to the PCG’s language fluency. He/she should easily express ideas about<br>the child/adolescent and other topics.<br>If the PCG tends to speak in one-word sentences or uses head shakes<br>instead of spoken words, then he/she would score lower on this scale.|
|**K4**|The key components areinitiation and spontaneity. In order to receive<br>higher scores on the scale, the PCG must demonstrate some initiative in<br>asking questions or making comments that go beyond the bare minimum<br>needed to give an answer. It is not necessary that he/she do this on all the<br>questions; however, occasionally she should take the initiative in the<br>conversation. The verbal exchange does not have to be detailed or even<br>relevant as long as there is some effort to start a dialogue.|
|**K6**|‘Together at any time’ refers to your entire time in the home, not just<br>during the Primary Caregiver-Child interview. Did you see any interaction<br>at any time?|
|**K7**|‘Spontaneously’ means that the child did not request a response or ask a<br>question of the primary caregiver.|
|**K8**|We are asking about frequency in which the PCG responded verbally to<br>child instead of hitting or using facial expressions to respond to the child’s<br>request. The verbal response can be either positive or negative in tone or<br>wording. The key factor here is that the PCG is responding to the child’s<br>or adolescent’s vocalization, not ignoring it.<br>Child/adolescent vocalization does not include expressions of distress such<br>as lengthy bouts of crying. If the child/adolescent does not vocalize during<br>the interview, thereby denying the PCG an opportunity to respond,_the_<br>_code would still be never_.|
|**K9**|This need not be a wild burst of showy affection. Simple signs of concern<br>such as a PCG gently tucking the child’s or adolescent’s shirt in, holding<br>him on her lap, holding a hand, or a gentle pat on the shoulder count.|



84


|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
||Caresses include a hug, a stroke of the hair, patting an arm or leg, reaching<br>out affectionately and touching the face, etc. Blowing kisses as well as<br>actually establishing physical contact may be counted as a kiss.<br>Affectionate speech without some accompanying action would not be<br>counted.|
|**K10**|The intent of this item is to determine if the PCG models aggression by use<br>of physical force to discipline or control others in the home during the<br>visit. This includes use of corporal punishment to discipline the<br>child/adolescent.<br>Occasionally a visitor will feel that he/she does not know whether a PCG is<br>playing a rough and tumble game or is seriously slapping/spanking a<br>child/adolescent, although this is less likely with infants than with older<br>children or teens.<br>The best guide to use in such instances is the child’s or adolescent’s<br>behavior. If the child/adolescent reacts with pleasure or happiness,<br>chances are this represents a style of positive interaction between him/her<br>and the PCG. If the child/adolescent frowns or looks unhappy or<br>whimpers or cries, you can feel more confident that, however the PCG<br>intended it, the child/adolescent does not perceive it as pleasurable.|
|**K11**|‘Restricted action’ refers to children/adolescents who are exploring a room<br>and a caregiver prevents them by picking them up and holding them or<br>putting them in a device that restrains them, or keeps them from<br>completing an action or activity.|
|**K13**|The intent of this item is to capture the feeling conveyed by the tone of the<br>PCG’s voice. Is the PCG pleased with her child? Does she enjoy her and<br>talk about her in a pleasant, joyful manner rather than talk in a flat tone?<br>Note that for this item the tone of voice to the child/adolescent or to the<br>interviewer about the child have to be assessed.|
|**K14**|The key word here is‘spontaneous.’ If the PCG, however, mentions a<br>positive attribute of the child/adolescent after you made your own ‘praise,’<br>then it can be coded here_as long as a new positive characteristic_ is<br>mentioned. For example, if you say, ‘she has lovely hair,’ if the PCG says<br>‘yes, and it is so pretty in that new style,’ then the PCG remark would not<br>be spontaneous praise. BUT if she says ‘Yes, and her eyes are so large,<br>people always comment on them,’ or ‘Yes, and she is such a lively girl<br>too,’ then these can be considered spontaneous praise by the PCG.|


85


|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
||In scoring this item, do not hesitate to read the adult’s affect. Any<br>achievement reported with pride should count (is quiet, can soothe herself,<br>has a good disposition, etc.).<br>Occasionally, however, an adult will indicate approval of the child’s<br>behavior by making what appears to be a negative statement, i.e., “I tell<br>you, this kid can really make a noise.” If this is said with a smile and is<br>immediately followed with some achievement, “Would you believe he<br>yelled for so long in the night that in the end his father had to get up and<br>hold him for a while?” from which one can infer that the adult is proud of<br>him, then consider this one instance of praise. Statements like these would<br>only be counted if some proof of positive feeling were offered.|
|**K15**|‘Warm and affectionate’ refer to both verbal as well as active displays of<br>warmth or affection.|
|**K16**|To be coded asyes, the respondent should introduce the child/adolescent to<br>you by name and in some way identify you for the child/adolescent. The<br>object is for the PCG to make the child/adolescent aware of your name and<br>the fact that you came to visit both of them and not just the PCG.|
|**K17**|This may include showing a trophy, a certificate, telling you how well the<br>child/adolescent is doing in school, how hard they work, or how good they<br>are with younger siblings. The child/adolescent does not have to be<br>present when the positive remark is made.<br>‘Show off’ can be interpreted liberally to include any context in which the<br>adult helps the child to demonstrate a skill. It does not necessarily mean<br>getting them to complete a complex puzzle, sing a song, or recite the<br>alphabet, although of course all of those would count. It could be asking<br>the child to show a favorite teddy, his special blanket, or bring in a new<br>item of clothing such as a baseball hat.<br>Other activities may be asking the child to count, show how a toy works or<br>anything that allows the child/adolescent to do something to impress the<br>visitor. The key is that the adult has the idea.<br>If the child/adolescent spontaneously does these things, it would not be<br>counted, since it is the adult that you are concerned with. While you may<br>think to yourself that a child/adolescent who demonstrates skill does so<br>because of previous teaching by the adult, it could be a result of a teacher,<br>a regular visitor, or even because the child feels neglected.<br>The intent of the observational items is that the interviewer iswitnessto<br>adult behaviors that facilitate development.|


86


|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
|**K18**|This item is designed to find out if the PCG demonstrated an active interest<br>in the child’s/adolescent’s experiences and activities. Does she actively<br>inquire about what he did when he was across the street at a friend’s<br>birthday party or what he did at Kindergarten in the morning?<br>In order to receive credit for this item, the PCG must make an active effort<br>to have the child or adolescent say something or relate his experiences.<br>Instances can be observed as the adult and child reunite after answering<br>your questions, if she asks questions such as “Have you been doing some<br>games with ***?” or “Did you behave yourself and tell Ms. *** all about<br>what you do at Nana’s?”<br>For this item ‘encourages’ can be passive as well as active. Thus, if a<br>child/adolescent joins into a conversation with the adult and you and is<br>allowed to contribute to the conversation with no discouragement, that<br>would be counted, as would a specific suggestion that the child should<br>“Tell Ms. *** about your school play.” Even if the child/adolescent is<br>subsequently asked to finish participating in the conversation it should be<br>counted.|
|**K19**|Note that in this item, we need for you, as the interviewer, to initiate a<br>complement or praise towards the child or adolescent. At K19, we want<br>you to code the PCG response to your praise of the child/adolescent.<br>Make certain that your praise is genuine (e.g. do not force praise that you<br>do not feel as you look at the child/adolescent). Usually you will have no<br>trouble deciding how to code this, as an adult might agree with you, add<br>more facts to encourage you further, beam, etc. Sometimes, however, you<br>will get little more than a “thank you” without feeling, or, no comment at<br>all. If so, find more than one occasion to praise the child/adolescent. If<br>you consistently get a response that shows no feeling or pleasure, then<br>code as never.<br>Be alert to observe the adult’s facial expression when you offer a remark.|
|**K20**|This item refers to the use of a common term of endearment or nickname<br>such as honey or sweetheart, or even a rather negative word if it is said<br>with positive feeling. Terms of endearment when speaking of or to the<br>child/adolescent should be counted.|
|**K21**|The main difference between these and the item related to ‘overt hostility’<br>(question K23) is that on these items the adult must make the negative<br>remark directly to the child/adolescent, saying for example “You are a bad<br>boy,” not (speaking to interviewer) “He is a bad boy.”<br>To be considered scolding/derogating the adult must tell the<br>child/adolescent directly that s/he is bad.|


87


|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
|**K22**|A positive code on this item requires that the adult raise her voice to a level<br>above that required by the distance between adult and child.|
|**K23**|This item deals with an overtly negative attitude toward the<br>child/adolescent on the part of the adult. Remarks may be made to or<br>about the child. Does the adult feel that the child/adolescent is in the way<br>or a nuisance? Is the adult angry with the child simply for being there?<br>To code as never, there must be no instance or derogatory, critical, or<br>demeaning remarks TO the child, or TO you about the child/adolescent<br>(note that this item differs from those relating to tone of voice towards the<br>child).<br>An adult would receive a positive score on this item if she complains that<br>the child/adolescent is hard to take care of, wearing her out, if she calls the<br>child/adolescent bad without the affectionate joke described above, and so<br>on.<br>Examples would be remarks such as, “I don’t know what I’m going to do<br>with this kid,” “She cries so much that I have not slept properly since she<br>was born,” or “This kid is driving me up the wall with all his fussiness.”<br>An adult might tell a child or teenager to stop doing something or correct<br>them several times during the interview and still gain never for this item if<br>her general tone is positive.|
|**K25**|Pride can be shown in voice or caregiver showing things the child has<br>accomplished or done.|
|**K28**|‘Perceptually monotonous’ is a home with very little on the walls or floor<br>and very little furniture. The home is dark and no personalization of the<br>home is evident (knick-knacks, paintings, etc.).<br>You should also look for lack of lighting, drawn drapes, lack of<br>pictures/plants, or a seeming lack of effort to make the home attractive.<br>All of these things will be counted whether or not you feel that the lack of<br>decoration is due to something outside the PCG’s control, such as an<br>uncaring landlord, lack of money, etc.|
|**K29**|‘Cluttered’ refers to disorganization in the home. Items are stacked on<br>each other. It is difficult to walk easily around the room without walking<br>on things or bumping into things.<br>Allowances should be made for differing styles of housekeeping. You<br>should be able to sit on a chair or sofa without first having to clear a space|


88


|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
||to sit, and the floor should be relatively free of clutter or trash.<br>As “Child Trends” indicates: “sometimes small homes or apartments do<br>not have a great deal of space for furniture. The issue here is not one of<br>closeness or tightness of furnishings, but of what additional is on the floor<br>or furniture. Would lots of things have to be put away so that you could<br>move or sit in the room? These things do not have to be dirty. Piles of<br>clean laundry, newspapers, or mail qualify! But again, the intent is not an<br>isolated pile.”<br>If one room is kept closed and used for ‘junk’ but the rest of the home is<br>free of clutter/mess then the house/apartment should be considered free of<br>clutter.|
|**K30**|‘Clean’ is very subjective. A clean house_would not have_ opened food on<br>the counter, garbage on the floor, and unhealthy or unsanitary conditions in<br>the home.|
|**K32**|In making a rough calculation of this item, a general rule of thumb is that a<br>9 x 12 room is about the right amount of space for one person. In general,<br>this means approximately 1-2 people per bedroom.|
|**K33**|Is the furniture arranged in a manner so that all of the exits are free and<br>easily accessible? Does the living area allow for freedom of movement<br>and room for the children to play, unless another specified area is<br>designated as a play area?<br>You are not looking for cleanliness, tidiness, or lack of danger in this item,<br>but for an idea that an active child is not able to move about, arrange their<br>toys or games, and has very limited freedom of movement within their<br>home.|
|**K34**|At K34, we ask about noisy from_inside the house_. <br>A certain amount of background noise is to be expected in a home with<br>one or more children/teenagers. Loud, distracting noises, however,<br>particularly those from sources such as a busy street just outside the<br>window, a highway close by, loud machinery, groups of people<br>congregating and shouting or playing boom boxes outside open windows<br>etc._should not be included_ in the rating here, since this item refers to noise<br>within the home.|
|**K35**|At K35, we ask about noisy from_outside the house_. A certain amount of<br>background noise is to be expected in a home, especially in the city. Loud,<br>distracting noises, however, particularly those from sources such as a busy|

||street just outside the window, a highway close by, loud machinery, groups<br>of people congregating and shouting or playing boom boxes outside open<br>windows etc._will be rated here_.<br>Noise from within the home, such as children playing or a teenager’s<br>stereo would not count and should not be included as part of this item in<br>the scale.|
|**K37**|**DEFINITION OF AFACE-BLOCK **<br>A face-block includes the opposite sides of a street block. Normally, this<br>will include both the east and west or north and south sides of a street<br>block. Corner buildings, such as apartment buildings or homes that have<br>entrances on two streets will be counted in both intersecting face-blocks.<br>There are times when the boundaries of a face-block will be unclear in<br>terms of the physical lay-out of the block. Ordinarily, street numbering or<br>the physical layout will make the boundaries of the face-block clear. There<br>may be some difficulty in defining a face-block in public housing projects<br>where there are no street names for interior sections of the project, or when<br>streets cross at angles. Use the guidelines below for such cases.<br>The definition of a face-block provided is easier to apply to cities in which<br>streets are arranged in a grid pattern. There are a number of difficulties<br>identifying a face-block when the observer is actually on the street<br>applying this definition. For this reason, face-blocks should be defined<br>with a detailed street map before leaving to make the visit/observation and<br>then verified by observation once you arrive at the home. The face-block<br>will always contain the respondent’s home, but decisions as to what<br>constitutes the face-block can be difficult. The following guidelines can be<br>used:<br>1.<br>A face block needs to be big enough to be meaningful. A<br>corner with two houses on it provides little information about<br>the neighborhood, unless it is a small part of a block that is<br>otherwise vacant. Sometimes several streets come together at<br>angles and leave small “islands” of buildings that do not<br>clearly form part of any block. Look out in particular for this<br>kind of angled intersection. A longer face-block with one side<br>continuous street and the other side with several smaller<br>blocks might better capture the characters of the community.<br>The general definition of a city bock is that there are 8 per<br>mile, which would translate to space for at least 5 buildings of<br>normal residential size on either side.|


90


|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
||2.<br>If a street has one long continuous side containing a large<br>industrial unit, railroad tracks, a large educational<br>establishment, or vacant land, then intersecting streets on the<br>opposite side should be used to break it down into distances<br>more equivalent to a city block. However, if both sides are<br>continuous, then let the geography or general layout of the<br>area define the face-block.<br>3.<br>The identification of the face-block from the map should be<br>verified by observing the makeup of the face-block at street-<br>level. Notes should be made of any problems with the block<br>as defined, and any decision rules that are used to modify the<br>pre-defined face-blocks.|
|**K38**|Use the following criteria to code the condition of the street:<br>**Condition**<br>**Description**<br>Very good<br>Street has recently been resurfaced and is smooth.<br>Moderate<br>Street has evidence that it is kept in good repair, such as<br>tar to fill cracks, potholes filled in, and free of signs of<br>deterioration.<br>Fair<br>Street has evidence of minor repairs, such as tar to fill<br>cracks in the road, so that surface is not too rough.<br>Poor<br>Street has lots of potholes and other evidence of neglect,<br>such as large pieces of gravel from road deteriorating.|
|**K39**|Look especially along curbs and gutters for evidence of litter and broken<br>glass.<br>The“None or almost none”response means that there is not any garbage,<br>litter, broken glass visible as you walk along and ordinarily there will be<br>evidence that the street is swept. Leaves and twigs may be on the street or<br>sidewalk after a storm. Do not treat that as litter.<br>The“Yes, but not a lot” response should be used for those cases where the<br>litter appears to be due to the occasional careless pedestrian or child; for<br>the most part that street and the sidewalks of the face-block will appear to<br>be clean.<br>The“Yes, just about everywhere” should be used in those cases where<br>there does not appear to be any effort to ever tidy up the streets or<br>sidewalks and one has to walk over or around the glass, etc.|

**PART B: SECTION OVERVIEWS FOR THE CHILD CAPI INSTRUMENT**


**Section** **Section Overview**



**Section E:**

**Reading and**
**Math Skills**


**Section F:**

**Electronic Media**


**Section H: Social**

**Relationships**


**Section J: Social**

**Institutions -**

**Religion, Work,**
**and School**



The Child questionnaire begins with Section E. You will find several
practice questions at the beginning of Section E to help the children and
adolescents understand how to respond to your questions by using a
response set on a scale.


Most of the remaining section focuses on a set of items querying the
respondents about their self-perceived math and reading abilities.


Section F focuses on use of electronic media, including electronic games
and computers. We have a detailed sequence of questions concerning the
purpose and frequency of the children’s and adolescents’ use of the
Internet.


Notice that the timeframe for these questions is “in the last month.”


In Section H, we have a series of questions that address peer interactions,
family relationships, and closeness to parents, siblings, and other adults.
We also have a series of questions about the children’s and adolescents’
health. These items (H2) query the respondents about the frequency in
which they experienced a number of physical symptoms. The timeframe
for all questions H1-H4 are “last month.” For children under 10 years of
age, this is the end of the Child CAPI interview.


Section J is for respondents 12 years of age and older. We begin Section J
with a couple open-ended questions that query the respondents about selfidentified ethnicity and religiosity.


If a child reports a religion at J2, then we ask four follow-up items:
importance of religion, comfort derived from religion, frequency of
religious service attendance, and frequency of participation in religious
activities. If the respondents do not endorse a specific religion at J2, then
we ask a parallel series of questions about spirituality – whether the
respondents feel spiritual, importance of spirituality in their lives, and
comfort derived from spirituality.


J2a “Interviewer Checkpoint” is designed to direct you through the
religiosity or spirituality follow-up questions. Record “religion
mentioned” at J2a if the respondent reported a specific, established religion
at J2; record “religion not mentioned” at J2a if the respondent said “none,”
“do not believe in god,” “human race,” etc.


96


**Section** **Section Overview**


At J5, we begin a series of questions about employment. We are interested
in learning, in detail, about children’s and adolescents’ work-for-pay. We
first ask about current full or part-time employment. At J19, we ask the
same series of questions about summer employment. We would like to
know about any work for which the respondent gets paid, but not about
things the respondent does to receive an allowance from his/her family.
We ask about allowances in another section of the interview.


The last set of items in Section J query respondents about school courses
they took during the past two terms, whether the courses were full or halfterm, and the grades received in the courses. These data were designed to
complement the teacher assessments being collected for children in
elementary school.


Children in grades 6-12 will list the name of the class and the grade
received in the class for seven instructional areas (English, math, science,
social science, foreign language, vocational, and “other” – such as art or
drama) for two prior terms. We ask for up to three “mentions” for each
instructional area. Because of the heterogeneity in class choice, names and
grading systems, we will use what you record and carry out detailed postfield coding. For this reason, it is important to probe and record the exact
name of the course.


Note that we are asking about the prior two terms. If you are interviewing
between October 2002 and January 2003, you will ask about the terms that
ended in June 2002 and January 2002. If you are interviewing in February
2003 or thereafter, you will ask about the terms that ended in January 2003
and June 2002. The CAPI instrument should fill the appropriate dates.



**Section K**

**(ACASI):**
**Activities, Health,**
**and Peer**

**Influence**



Sections K and L are self-administered by the respondent, using the
computer. You will use the practice questions to instruct the respondent
on how to use the computer and record responses.


In Section K, we ask about respondents’ involvement in school and
community activities, how much time they spend in these activities, and
their friends’ involvement in such activities. The timeframe for these
items is past 12 months.


Beginning at K8, we ask a series of questions about health, including: selfrated health, self-perceived body weight and things that the respondents do
to maintain, reduce, or increase weight; nutritional intake, exercise, and
sleep. Note that the timeframe for many of these items is past seven days.
At K18-K19, we ask about limitations in activities due to health or
emotional problem in the past month. Note that at K24, the timeframe
reference shifts to “last 6 months.” The K24 series is about giving support
to family and friends.


97


**Section** **Section Overview**



**Section L (ACASI**
**Continued, for 12**
**Years and Up)**



Section L is for the 12 year old and up. Section L starts out with a few
practice items, and then moves into a series of questions on savings and
expenditures. Note that the timeframe shifts in L4a, L5, and L6. In L4a,
the timeframe is last month; L5 is last three months; and L6 is last 12
months.


At L7, we ask a few questions about dating behaviors, and then at L9, we
ask about school aspirations. At L12, we begin a detailed series about
tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. We want to know if the respondents
regularly use tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, the age or onset of use, frequency
of use, and intensity of use.


The remainder of Section L queries the respondents about their
connectedness and autonomy with family and friends, sexual experiences
and pregnancy, and enjoyment of life and social well-being.

**PART C: CHILD ACASI MODULE**


**What is ACASI?** “ACASI” stands for “Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview”. Since
some of the questions in Sections K and L ask about more personal and
sensitive topics, we have set them up so the respondents have the most
privacy possible. As the questions come up on the screen, a recording will
be played automatically over a pair of headphones. The respondents will
type the answers into the computer themselves instead of telling you the

response.

Respondents aged 10 years and older will complete Section K, while
children aged 12 years and older will go on to complete Section L as well.


There are a few steps to prepare the respondent and the computer to
complete these sections.


First, you will read an introduction that explains the ACASI section to the
child. Give the computer to the child and make sure the laptop is arranged
conveniently for the child’s use. It is important to consider the child’s
privacy as well as comfort and convenience when positioning the laptop.
You should not be able to see the computer screen or the keyboard while
the child completes ACASI. Remember not everyone has used a computer
before, so be sure you explain these directions carefully.


**P** **RIMARY** **K** **EYS**
Once the equipment is arranged, you will need to show the child the
location of some of the keys he or she will be using. Make sure the
“ACASI” keyboard card is out and situated in plain view. The respondents
will use this card as a reminder of how to navigate the questions using the
keyboard.

|KEY|FUNCTION|
|---|---|
|**Number keys**|Used for amount answers|
|**Period key**|Used for amount answers|
|**<Enter>**|Press <Enter> after selecting a response in order to<br>go to the next question.|
|**<Backspace>**|Press <Backspace> to delete an answer.|
|**<F11>**|Press <F11> to replay the question.|
|**<Ctrl><D>**|Press <Ctrl><D> for Don’t Know responses.|
|**<Ctrl><R>**|Press <Ctrl><R> for Refused responses|
|**Space bar**|To select more than one response option, use the<br>space bar to separate each response.|

**Helping the**
**Respondent**



Do not instruct the respondents to back up in the questionnaire.
If they need to back up a question for any reason, have them ask you for
help. When you back up a question, the entire question will be re-played.
You may interrupt the question by pressing the <Ctrl> and <F11> keys at
the same time. Do not show the child this function; it is for your use only.


Instruct the respondent to listen to the entire question.
Instruct the respondent to listen to the entire question and all the responses
before answering. The respondent will be able to enter a response before
the entire question is read but do not encourage them to do so.


Set up the audio component.
After you have oriented the child to the computer, attach the headphones to
the computer and show the child how to adjust the volume. Adjust the
headphones so they fit comfortably and the sound is at the appropriate
level.


Take time with the practice items.
The respondent will work through a few practice items before getting
started with Section K. Stay with the respondent while he or she completes
these questions so you can help if necessary.


Some children or adolescents may need more assistance from you than
others. Such assistance may be as minor as showing the respondent how to
record a dollar amount. Other times, assistance may be more involved,
such as showing the respondent how to delete and re-record a response.


You should give the respondent any help that is requested. Be careful,
however, not to seem intrusive or give more help than requested. Too
much assistance may be perceived as invasive and, consequently, result in
a loss of privacy. Answer any questions and then move away from the
respondent so he/she can complete the rest of the questions in privacy.


Prioritize verbal assistance.
If the respondent asks for help, you should attempt to give verbal
assistance first – without looking at the screen. If verbal assistance is
unsuccessful, then you may need to look at the laptop. Give the child the
option to delete the answer on the screen using the <Backspace> key.


Do not appear to rush the respondent.
This includes body language as well as spoken comments. The ACASI
questions are important and some are sensitive, so the child must be
allowed to take as much time as necessary.

**ACASI**

**Troubleshooting –**
**If the R Cannot Hear**

**the Voice Recording**



If the respondent cannot hear the voice recording, use these
techniques to troubleshoot the problem:


- Make sure the instrument is at a screen which is supposed to have
sound. The voice will not start until the screen labeled

**INTRO_K0a** .

- Try adjusting the volume. There is volume control on the laptop
and on the headset. Make sure you adjust the volume in both
places.

- Make sure the headphone jack is in the correct socket – there may
be several similar ones nearby.

- Make sure the headphone jack is pushed in all the way.

- If you have tried all of these tips and there is still no sound or if
there are very long delays in moving screen to screen, contact the
Help Desk for assistance.



**Blaise Troubleshooting** _Error messages_

If the child gives an invalid response or enters an invalid range, an
error message will appear and the child is instructed to clear the
message by pressing the <Enter> key and to re-enter the response.
Please instruct the child to ask for your assistance if any other error
messages come up. If you cannot fix the error, call your Team Leader
or the Help Desk for assistance.



**When ACASI is**

**Completed**



At the end of the ACASI section, the child will return the computer to
you. At this point, the Child-CAPI interview is complete!

|**E11-E20**|In questions E11-E20, we ask the children to rate their reading abilities.<br>Most younger children will have reading classes in school. Some older<br>children, however, are more likely not to have specific reading classes, but<br>will have English classes or English literature classes. If children do not<br>understand the questions using “reading,” English literature or English<br>class can be used as a substitute. Make sure to point out that the English<br>class does not include English language classes (i.e., classes in which<br>children are learning to speak the English language as a second language<br>such as a Spanish class).|
|**E20**|No matter what option you used in E11-19, read as written. “Reading” in<br>this question refers to the activity of reading, not reading classes.|
|**F1a;**<br>**F1b**|Use of the media can take place anywhere including their home, someone<br>else’s home, school, etc.|
|**F4**|We want the exact web URL address of their favorite website (for<br>example, www.yahoo.com). If child does not know the URL get<br>descriptive information about the website, like a keyword.|
|**G1**|“Giving” at this question refers to voluntary and involuntary giving.|
|**H1a-d**|The focus of these questions is on relationships with the child’s peers – at<br>school and in the neighborhood. It does not include relationships with<br>siblings.|
|**H1d**|“Purposely” means that it wasn’t an accident or a mistake.|
|**H2a, H2e, H2f,**<br>**H2g, H2h**|We want to know how often the child felt sick, regardless if they saw a<br>doctor or stayed home from school because of feeling ill.|
|**H4a**|“Talk with” can be a conversation of any length.<br>Note that we first ask about the biological mother at H4a, then the<br>stepmother at H4c. The CAPI instrument will guide you – pathing and<br>fills are based on response to H3.|

|QUESTION|QUESTION OBJECTIVE|
|---|---|
|**H4a**|If the respondents report that they do not have any friends at H4a, record<br>“7.” The questionnaire will then skip over question items that ask about<br>friends.|
|**H4c, f, i**|If the respondents report that they do not have any problems at school at<br>H4c, f, i, record “never.”|
|**H5**|By “close,” we mean emotionally close, not physical distance. Keep in<br>might that some children are very literal.|
|**J1**|This is an open question - record verbatim whatever the adolescents thinks<br>of as their race or ethnic group. Do not probe DK responses.|
|**J2**|People can consider themselves as belonging to a particular religion even<br>if they don’t attend services. Make sure that you are clear about the name<br>of the religion. If in doubt, ask them to spell it. “None” is an acceptable<br>answer.Do not probe DKresponses.|
|**J2a**|J2a is an interviewer checkpoint. If the child reported a religion at J2,<br>record “1.” If the child refused to respond, answered “Don’t Know,”<br>reported not having a religion by saying something like “None,” “No<br>God,” or reported something like “American” or “Human,” then record<br>“2,” You will skip over the organized religion questions, and ask<br>questions about feeling spiritual.|
|**J3a**|By “comfort” we mean a feeling of relief or encouragement.|
|**J3b**|Do not include weddings, funerals, or other special purpose services as<br>attending religious services.|
|**J4**|Spirituality is when you try to find out answers to big questions about life<br>and meaning such as “Why am I here?” or “Why did something bad<br>happen to someone I know?” It can be the same thing as going to church,<br>but does not have to be. Many people that do not go to church are still<br>spiritual.|
|**J5**|We are interested in work-for-pay, not volunteer work. The range of jobs<br>may be broad – for example, yard work for neighbors, camp counselors, or<br>work in established businesses or retail.|

**PART A: SUMMARY NOTES FOR THE ASSESSMENTS BOOKLET**


**Overview** The Assessments Booklet is a paper-and-pencil instrument that you will
administer to all CDS children/adolescents. It contains two primary
sections: measurement of height and weight, and the
achievement/memory tests.


**Color of Booklet** Ivory


**Respondent** All children and adolescents



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Face-to-Face **ONLY**
Paper-and Pencil-Administration



**Main Objective** To obtain information on body weight and height, as well as cognitive
skills of children and adolescents.


**Notes and Rules** There are specific instructions for gathering standardized and accurate
measurement of the child’s height and weight as well as for administering
the achievement and memory tests. We cannot allow any divergence from
the protocols for this instrument, nor changes, additions, or deletions in
wording of the individual items in the cognitive assessments.



**Key Objectives of**
**the Instrument**



To obtain information on body weight and height which will be used to
calculate a standardized measurement of body mass index.
To obtain information on cognitive skills of children and adolescents
through standardized achievement tests and short-term memory test.

**Introduction**


**Measurement**

**Tools**


**General**

**Procedures**


**Measuring**
**Respondent’s**
**Height**



You will attempt to measure the children’s and adolescents’ height and
weight, using the tools provided in your bulk materials. It is important to
obtain accurate measurements so please take the time to review procedures
and practice on children and adolescents if at all possible. The
measurements you take will be converted into standardized scores so that
we can compare the information from the CDS sample with other national
child and adolescent health studies that set benchmarks for body mass
index for the United States.


You should receive a scale, rafter’s square, tape measure, and post-it notes
in your bulk materials. Take a moment to test the scale and make sure that
it is working properly before your first household appointment.


There are a few general procedures to follow when conducting the height
and weight measurements. They are:


When measuring respondents’ height and weight, do not physically touch
the respondents (e.g., do not help the respondents onto the scale or take off
their shoes). Be certain, however, that younger children safely step on/off
the scale.


If the respondent is under 6 years, get assistance from the PCG or a family
member to take off the respondent’s shoes, help the respondent onto the
scale, stand still, etc. Give the directions to both the respondent and family
member assisting you. You will complete Questions 1 and 2.


If the respondent is 6 years or older, you can instruct the respondent
directly. A family member can also assist you with respondents of this age
if necessary. You will complete Questions 1 and 2.


If the respondent refuses to be measured, ask the primary caregiver to give
you the respondent’s height and weight and the date the respondent was
last measured, or their best estimate. You should complete Questions 3
and 4 in the Assessments Booklet.


There are several specific steps to measuring the respondent’s height:


- Ask the respondent to take off his/her shoes and to stand against a wall
or door.

- Place a Post-it note on the wall right above the respondent’s head.

- Position your rafter’s square against the wall directly over the
respondent’s head.

- Make a mark on the Post-it note at the respondent’s height.

- Ask the respondent to move away from the wall.

- Position the tape measure under a door jam or your foot and measure
from the floor to the mark on the Post-it.


108


**Measuring**
**Respondent’s**
**Weight**


**A3 and A4: PCG**

**Reported Height**
**and Weight**




- Record (his/her) height in the Assessments Booklet at A1 and remove
the Post-it from the wall.

- Another option is to ask the primary caregiver to measure the
respondent for you and give you the number. Follow the age
guidelines concerning assistance from the PCG or another family
member.


There are several specific steps to measuring the respondent’s weight:


- In addition to having the respondent remove his/her shoes, ask the
respondent to empty his/her pockets of any heavy items.

- Activate the scale and set the scale to zero.

- Once the scale shows 0.0, have the respondent step on the scale
(following the age guidelines above).

- Have the respondent stand in the center of the scale. The respondent
may need to stand on the center of the scale for 5-10 seconds to assess
an accurate weight.


Only record information in A3 and A4 if you are unable to actually
measure and weigh the respondent.


If the respondent refuses to be measured, ask the primary caregiver for the
respondent’s height and weight at the last doctor visit. Record the
information at A3a and A4a on page 3 of the Assessments Booklet.
Record the approximate length of time since that doctor visit at A3b and
A4b.


If the PCG does not remember exact measurements, record “best estimate”
at question items A3c and A4c.

**PART C: COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS**


_(Information for this section on the Woodcock-Johnson test administration was paraphrased_
_from the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement-Revised, Standard and Supplemental Batteries_
_Manual, Woodcock, R. W. & Mather, N. (1990). DLM Teaching Resources, TX)_



**Introduction to**

**Cognitive**
**Assessments**


**Measurement**

**Tools**


**The Importance**
**of a Quiet**
**Environment**



The Cognitive Assessments in the CDS consist of two components: (1)
three subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Test of Achievement, and
(2) the WISC-III Digit Span test for short-term memory.


The Woodcock-Johnson Revised Test of Achievement is a well-known,
established educational assessment tool. Depending on the age of the
respondent, you will administer either two or three subscales of the
Woodcock-Johnson. For respondents aged 4 to 5 years, you will
administer only two subtests. For respondents 6 years and older, you will
administer three subtests. These tests are brief, and are interesting and
enjoyable to children and adolescents alike. They are:


Letter-Word Identification: for 4 years and older
Passage Comprehension: for 6 years and older
Applied Problems: for 4 years and older


The WISC Digit Span Test is another type of assessment, which tests the
respondent’s memory. There are two parts: a digit-forward memory test
and a digit-backward memory test.


The items you will need to administer the Woodcock-Johnson Test and
Digit Span Test are: (1) Woodcock-Johnson easel, (2) Assessments
Booklet to record responses, (3) a blank piece of paper for the respondent
to write on during the applied problems subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson,
and (4) pencils for you and the respondent.


It is important when testing children/adolescents on standardized
assessments to administer the test in a quiet environment with no other
adults or children present to disrupt the respondent’s concentration.


When setting the appointment with the primary caregivers, make sure to
tell them that you will administer a few standardized assessments to the
children/adolescents. Be clear about the need to have a space in the home
that is private. Research has shown that scores on these assessments are
negatively affected by outside interference of noise or people in the testing
environment. Let the primary caregiver know that any interference could
negatively affect the accuracy of the assessment.


110


**Easel Test** The Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-R) Test of Achievement is an ‘easel’ test, or
a test with a response book that sits in front of the respondent. Easel tests
are administered in the following order:


          - You will ask the respondent to point to an object or say something.

          - The respondent will review the options on the page and point or say
something.

          - You record the respondent’s response.


Scoring the test is done back in the Ann Arbor office and out of sight of the
parent or respondent.


**Stay in Control** As with regular interviewing, it is important to control the setting of the
assessment. For the Woodcock-Johnson easel test, place the easel at an
angle so that you and the respondent can both see the stimuli (pictures)
simultaneously. You will need to see the choice that the respondent has
made without much movement or effort. Do not let the respondent flip the
page forward on the easel test. Stay upbeat and positive throughout the
testing time. Children and adolescents will respond to the atmosphere that
you create.


Children and adolescents, especially young children, can be difficult to test
and control. Try to keep the respondents ‘on task’ by repeatedly referring
to and touching the easel test. Use positive and encouraging words such as
“Good job,” “You are really pointing well,” “You are really good at
pointing to pictures,” and “You are really good at this.” You should,
however, avoid statements that are reflective of the respondent’s progress
on the test.



**Avoid Statements**

**that Refer to the**

**Respondent’s**
**Progress**



Always **avoid** statements that refer to the respondent’s progress on the test.
Do **not** use statements like “You got that right,” “No, that is not right,” and
“Are you sure that is the right answer?” Also, be very careful not to give
any facial expression or movement of the head that may indicate that the
respondent has answered an item right or wrong. The respondents will
look at you to check their progress, especially if they are unsure about their
answer. **Avoid** any expression that would give them feedback on their

progress.


111


**Be Aware of the**

**Respondent’s**
**Mood**


**Administer Test**

**Exactly as**
**Written**


**Special**
**Circumstances:**

**Preschoolers**



Be aware of the mood of the respondent during testing. Some children and
adolescents will get very tired and just start pointing to pictures without
thinking. If the respondent seems to be getting tired, take a short break (5
minutes) between the sub-tests and let the respondent get up and move
around the testing area or get a drink of water. Do not break during one of
the sub-tests, only between them. Do not let them leave the testing area.
They may not come back.


Some respondents will also get bored with the task. Try to gauge whether
they are tired or just bored. If they seem bored, try to encourage them that
the assessment will be over soon. Vary the tone in your voice as well as
giving many encouraging statements.


Each test **must be administered** **EXACTLY** as described in training and
in this manual. Any deviation from these procedures will invalidate the
results.


Standardized test administration should be approached with the
understanding that the instructions and wording of the test should not vary
in any way. Words cannot be added, left out, or substituted. The goal of a
standardized test is to measure how well individuals respond to questions
when given identical instructions. An examiner in New York should be
asking the exact same questions as an examiner in San Francisco. When
administered in this manner, the respondents in both of these cities will
have been given the identical test and their scores will be based only on
their ability, and not the testing situation.


The most common mistakes made in using standardized tests, by both
experienced and inexperienced interviewers, is to accidentally point to the
correct answer on the test or to change the wording of the instructions.


There are some exceptions to the restrictions detailed above that involve a
respondent’s special reception and/or response limitations. Three general
groups that sometimes require small changes in the assessment procedures
are preschoolers, English as a second language (ESL), and individuals with
disabilities.


**P** **RESCHOOLERS**
Young children are often frightened of adults they do not know. If the
child refuses to be tested without a parent in the room or continually cries
because they are frightened, then ask the mother (or primary caregiver) to
remain in the room with the child. Explain to the primary caregiver that it
is important not to assist the child in any way. If you believe that the test
results are invalid due to extra help given by the primary caregiver or
someone else, please note that in the interviewer notes at the end of the
questionnaire.

**E** **NGLISH** **A** **S** **A** **S** **ECOND** **L** **ANGUAGE**
If any child or adolescent is having difficulty understanding you, repeat the
instructions. If they do not understand English at all, they cannot be tested
with the English language assessments. You may be able to arrange for a
Spanish-language assessment; consult your TL if you believe this is

necessary.


**D** **ISABILITIES**
Always check to see if a respondent should be wearing a hearing aid,
glasses, or other device that helps them to see, hear, or respond to
questions. Most of the measures require pointing. If a respondent is
unable to point, it is acceptable for them to describe their answer to the
interviewer. If a respondent is unable to speak, they can point. Be sure to
make notes in the thumbnail section of the Assessments Booklet about any
hearing, visual, or physical impairment that may affect the testing situation.



**Basal and Ceiling** Scoring for the WJ-R is done using basal and ceiling. Items in the WJ-R
are arranged by difficulty. The easiest questions are presented first and the
items get increasingly difficult as the respondent proceeds through the test.
Since the WJ-R can be used for respondents from ages 2 to 90 years, the
test includes items ranging in difficulty between those ages. The basal and
ceiling criteria were created to limit the amount of time any one person
spends on each subtest.


When the respondent gets **six or more consecutive items correct,** then
they have established their **basal** . If you are testing a respondent and start
with item 13 and the respondent does not get six in a row correct, you must
then test backward by complete pages starting at the beginning or top of
each page and going to the end.


It is possible that a respondent will never get six consecutive items
complete before they reach Item 1 of the subtest. In these cases the basal is
considered to be Item 1.


The interviewer continues testing until the respondent establishes **ceiling,**
which is **six or more consecutive items incorrect and the end of the**

**testing page has been reached.**


113


**Starting Points** You want to start testing at the appropriate starting point for the
respondent’s abilities. Unfortunately, we don’t know that ahead of time, so
we use the education level of the adult or child as a guideline. At the
beginning of every subtest, usually on the first page, there is a chart that
tells the interviewer at what item they should start administering the test
(see example below).


















|Preschool to<br>Kindergarten|Grade<br>1|Grade<br>2|Grade<br>3|Grades<br>4-6|Grades<br>7-9|Grade 10 to<br>Avg. Adult|College &<br>Above Avg.<br>Adult|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Item<br>1|Item<br>9|Item<br>13|Item<br>20|Item<br>24|Item<br>28|Item<br>32|Item<br>36|



**Test Complete**
**Pages**



To administer the test, the interviewer turns to the page where the starting
item is located. The interviewer begins administering the test.


One important concept to remember about the WJ-R is that you always test
in complete pages. **You never stop testing in the middle of a page** .


If you start a new page, even if the respondent reaches basal or ceiling at
the beginning or middle of the page, you must complete the full page. This
way the respondent does not know that they have reached the criteria set by
the WJ-R.


This idea of testing in complete pages is especially important when finding
the basal and ceiling. For example, if you are trying to establish **ceiling**, it
is likely that a respondent will get six consecutive items wrong in a row but
not be at the end of the page. Sometimes when you continue testing to
finish the page, a respondent will get an item correct. If they get an item
correct, even after they have gotten six consecutive items wrong, **you must**
**continue testing them until they get both six consecutive items**
**incorrect and have reached the end of the page** .



**Scoring** When a respondent gets an item correct, record a ‘1’ on the scoring page
for the specific test in the Assessments Booklet. If the respondent gets an
answer wrong, record a ‘0.’ You should always try to stay consistent with
your hand movements when marking the answers as the respondent will be
watching you for feedback.


114


**Timing** Allow the respondent a reasonable amount of time to answer, and then
move on even though (he/she) might get the answer if given more time to
think.


For calculation problems that a respondent is struggling with, allow at most
approximately double the respondent’s average time to compute an answer,
and then have (him/her) move on to the next problem.


For computation, the respondent can use a blank piece of paper for
calculating answers. It is best to take the paper back from the respondent
after the Woodcock-Johnson assessment is completed, to help keep
(him/her) focused on the Digit Span assessment that comes next.


**Sample Items** For children in 2nd grade or lower, administer all of the sample items
before starting the assessment. For children grade 3 and higher, only
administer Sample A for Letter-Word and Passage Comprehension. No
sample is administered for Applied Problems for grades 3 and up.

**PART A: SUMMARY NOTES FOR THE TIME DIARY**


**Respondent** Children and adolescents complete the time diary themselves, or with the
assistance of the primary caregiver. For very young children, the primary
caregivers may complete the diary themselves.


**Color of Booklet** Yellow for Weekday Diary; Goldenrod for Weekend Diary



**Mode of**

**Administration**



Mail Ahead w/ Face to Face Editing (Preferred)
Mail Ahead w/ Phone or Face to Face Interview (Optional)



**Main Objective** To obtain information on the time-use of children during a randomly
selected weekday and weekend day. Diary days will be assigned by the
computer during the Coverscreen application.


**Notes and Rules** The time diary is mailed in advance to the respondent’s home. The CDS
children and adolescents complete the time diary themselves, with
assistance by the primary caregiver as needed.


If diary is not complete at interview time, you will administer diary.


If the time diary is completed at the time of the household visit, you must
carefully edit the diary with the child/adolescent and/or PCG during the
household visit (preferred) or on the phone (optional).


Diary must complete a 24-hour day.



**Key Objectives of**
**the Instrument**



To obtain information on:

- activities during children’s days

- who interacts with children during weekdays and weekend days

- how many activities children participate in on a daily basis.

**PART B: TIME DIARY ADMINISTRATION**


**Introduction** The purpose of the time diary is to obtain the best possible information
about children’s and adolescent’s time use. Time Diaries are an
important and innovative survey tool for gathering such information, and
have been receiving a significant amount of attention in the research
circles that focus on children and adolescents.



**Who is**

**Interviewed?**


**Diary Day**
**Assignments**


**Mail Ahead**

**Approach**



Respondents find the time diary interesting to do, but reconstructing a 24hour period is sometimes difficult. For younger children, we have found
that it is often best to interview the children and primary caregiver
together to get the most accurate diary data. Even very young children (4
or 5 years old) can often tell you what they did, and the primary caregiver
can help anchor the times by recalling what time the child got up, ate
lunch, etc.


Adolescents, on the other hand, may be better at detailing their daily
activities themselves. Parents may not be aware of all of the details we
ask for each activity recorded in the time diary of a teenager’s life (for
example, the name of the specific TV show that the adolescent watched,
or whom the adolescent was with). You may take the diary information
from them without the primary caregiver’s help if they clearly recall the
day and can place times on their activities.


There are diary assignments for two days of the week: one weekday and
one weekend day. All children or adolescents in the CDS household will
have the same diary days. Blaise will randomly assign a diary weekday
and weekend day for the children/adolescents in each household at the
end of the Coverscreen block.


Because it is difficult to remember our activities in detail for very long, it
is essential that we collect the diary information as close to the diary day
as possible. We hope that using a ‘mail ahead’ diary will help provide us
with accurate information about the child(ren)’s activities on the selected
days, as well as streamline the time you spend with the family.


You will use a ‘mail ahead’ diary administrative approach, meaning you
will mail the time diaries to the CDS household in advance of your visit,
and request that the respondents complete the diaries about two preselected days on their own. Make sure you explain the diaries clearly
during the Coverscreen module, and encourage the respondents to fill
them out before the interview. Advance completion of the diaries
improves the accuracy of the data (shortens recall period and makes it
easier to remember) and reduces the amount of time you will be in the
household.


124


**Before Mailing the**
**Diaries: Items to**

**Complete on the**
**Cover and Inside**

**the Booklet**


**Instructions and**

**Example**


**Reviewing and**
**Probing**



Before you send the time diaries to the household, there are several items
on the cover and inside the booklet you must complete.


1. The first step is to make sure you have a **WEEKDAY** and a
**WEEKEND** diary for each child or adolescent.


2. Record the child’s/adolescent’s **SID** in the upper left corner.


3. In the lower left corner, record the child’s/adolescent’s first
name (first name only!) and diary day of the week (not the
date!) displayed in the Coverscreen module.


4. If there is a secondary caregiver in the home, record the name
of that individual at A8. If there is not a secondary caregiver
for that child/adolescent (as noted in the Coverscreen module),
then place an “X” through the page with questions A8-A9.


The second page of the time diary contains instructions for the
respondents for completing the time diary.


Following the instructions is an example of a time diary for an 8-year-old
child. The example includes descriptions of the child’s activities and
illustrates how the time dairy should be completed. Please instruct the
respondent to read the instructions carefully before filling out the diaries.


If the respondents completed the time diary in advance of your household
visit, you will still need to review the diary with them before you leave
the house. This is a necessary and mandatory step that serves to greatly
improve the overall quality of data in the diary.


To gather the necessary information, you will need to probe more
extensively than what you do in the CDS CAPI instruments. Unlike the
rest of the questionnaires, you do not need to record all your probes in the
time diary. Please probe any answer that is not clear to you. If its not
clear to you, it will likely not be clear to the coders who will work with
the diaries after you mail them to Ann Arbor.


Probe for detail! Respondents may say at first that they/their child ‘just
sat around all day.’ After probing, however, you will learn that they
probably did other things as well, such as washed and dressed, ate meals,
went to school, talked with friends or family, watched TV or did other
things.


Be especially attentive to activities that respondents report taking more
than 4 hours (except sleep or going to school or work). For example, if
the respondents report that they/their child was ‘playing’ for 4 hours,


125


probe to find out more about what types of things the child did. Did
(he/she) watch any TV? Go outside to play? Eat a snack or meal?
Record activities in the respondents’ own words and probe for detail, so
we know, for example, whether they were reading a book or magazine
(do not record just “reading”), or was playing a board game or a game of
soccer (do not record just “playing a game”). If there are gaps or
overlapping times, probe to get corrected information.


If some of the columns are blank, be sure they get filled in where
appropriate. Check also for legible handwriting and make sure that the
respondent’s answers meet the objectives of the questionnaire. Make sure
every minute is described. The end time of one activity should be the
beginning time of the next activity. The time you spend carefully
reviewing and editing the diary greatly expands the analytic value of the
instrument. Time use data are one of the most important trends in
research on children and adolescents!


Things to look for when reviewing a time diary with the respondent:

          - The activities are verbs.

          - The activities are what the child/adolescent was doing.

          - Times are correct and add up (read each activity with the beginning
and end time out loud as you review the diary to be sure it is correct).

          - Probe any long periods of time (any activity lasting over 4 hours
except going to school or sleeping).

          - Probe ‘playing’ to find out what the child/adolescent was playing.

          - Probe ‘reading’ to find out what the child/adolescent was reading
(book, magazine) and whether the child/adolescent was reading or
being read to.

          - Probe if the name of the TV shows, videos, computer games, or books
are not filled in.

          - Probe if secondary activity is not filled in.

          - Check for legible handwriting.

          - Check for travel times between locations and probe to include these if
needed.

          - Make sure that “with whom the child/adolescent is doing the activity”
and “who else is in the same location” columns are completed.

          - Probing is not necessary in Columns G, H and J if the child is
sleeping, doing personal care activities, at school, or at work.


**Editing the Diary** Editing takes place when you have finished interviewing or reviewing the
time diary with the respondent. Use the Editing Checklist (see Appendix
F) and review the completed time diary as follows:


          - Make sure the correct day, date, and child’s/adolescent’s name are on
the front of the face sheet.

          - Make sure all entries are legible.


126


**After Completing**
**the Diaries with**

**the Respondents**




- Complete the interviewer box on the front of the questionnaire that
contains mode of interview, date of interview, length of interview,
and length of edit.

- Length of edit is the time you spend cleaning up and checking the
time diary after you have left the respondent’s home.

- Interview length is the time you spent with the respondent reviewing
or administering the diary.

- Note on the inside of the face sheet any unusual situations or
problems that coders should know about.

- Double check to be sure the entire 24-hour period is accounted for
without gaps or overlaps.


Record **mode of interview** . Mode of interview refers to how the time
diary was completed. Response codes are (1) SAQ; (2) FtF; (3)
Telephone. Record all that apply. For example, if the respondents
recorded information on their own, and you edited the diaries in person
while at the home, you would circle “(1) SAQ” and “(2) FtF.” If the
respondent did not complete any of the diaries on her own and you
administered the time diaries while at the home, you would circle “(2)
FtF.”


Record **respondent** . Respondent refers to the individual who completed
the time diary – either alone or with you. The response codes are (1)
Child/Adolescent; (2) PCG. Record all that apply. For example, if the
PCG and the child did the diary together, then circle both “(1)
Child/Adolescent” and “(2) PCG.” If you worked with just the adolescent
on the diary, without PCG assistance, then just circle “(1)
Child/Adolescent.”


In the bottom right corner is a box with “Date of IW,” “Length of IW,”
and “Length of Edit.” For the time diaries, we define **IW** as the
interaction between you and the respondent (PCG and/or
child/adolescent) engaged in the tasks of administering or editing the time
diary. **Edit** refers to task of reviewing and annotating the time diary on
your own, when you return home. Record the information for these three
items in this box:


**Date of IW** is the date on which the interviewer talked with the
respondent to administer or edit the interview.


**Length of IW** should be calculated and recorded. The interview
length is the amount of time the interviewer spent talking with the
respondent, either collecting or reviewing the child’s time diary
information.


**Length of Edit** is the amount of time the Iwer spends going over the
diary after it is completed and edited with the PCG and/or the child to
get it ready to send to Ann Arbor.


127


**Standards for**

**Diaries**



Two things to keep in mind when editing and administering time diaries
are: (1) every minute of a 24-hour time period must be accounted for; (2)
there is never too much detail – the researchers code these data in very
fine level detail, so the more information you and the respondent provide,
the more accurate the data coding.


A key objective of the time diary method is to account for every minute in
a given time frame. The time diary for CDS encompasses a 24-hour
period, beginning at midnight and ending at midnight. You and the
respondent must have activities and details about such activities recorded
for every minute in the entire 24-hour period of the selected time diary
day.


We cannot stress enough the importance of complete data. It is extremely
important that the respondent does not leave any gaps of time in
accounting for the 24-hour period. All analyses assume that each
child/adolescent has 1440 minutes to spend on each selected day. If the
respondent doesn’t want to indicate or can’t remember the specific
activity and requested details for a certain period of time, you must note
this in the diary.


Include as much detail about the activity as possible.


In addition to the activity itself, we need to know where the activity took
place and whether other people were involved in the activity. See the
probing instructions for details on different types of locations and key
points to keep in mind when reviewing. We need as accurate information
as possible about who is interacting with the child and who else is in the
same place but not directly interacting with the child. The next section
provides more details about recording and probing activities.


We are also trying to get a better understanding of secondary activities.
The question ‘Was the child doing anything else at the same time?’ is
extremely useful in picking up activities that might not normally be
reported. If it was left blank, you need to probe for any secondary
activities.


Look over the sample time diary that is included in the first pages of the
time diary booklet to get an idea of the amount of detail we would like.
If, in cases where you interview two siblings, you find a discrepancy
between the diaries, do not revise either one in an attempt to make them
identical.

mailing it to the household.

          - Collect the questionnaire(s) at the end of the in-home interview. If the
questionnaires are not completed by the OCG by the end of the inhome interview, try to complete the first questionnaire while at the
home, or, if necessary, complete by the phone.

          - If you have to interview the OCG in person or on the phone, use an
OCG questionnaire to mark the R’s answers during the interview.
Have the OCG use a blank OCG questionnaire for a respondent
booklet. If you do not complete these questionnaire(s) before you
leave the household, leave a blank OCG questionnaire for the OCG to
use as a respondent booklet when you are completing the questionnaire
over the phone.

**Introduction to**

**Interviewing**
**Children and**

**Adolescents**



**PART A: PREPARING FOR THE INTERVIEW**


Interviewing in households with children poses a special challenge for
Interviewers, particularly when the Interviewer needs to talk with the
children one at a time in a quiet setting away from the rest of the
household. While there is no guaranteed way to make every interview go
completely smoothly, there are several tricks you can use to increase the
chances that this will be a fun and pleasurable experience for you, the
children, and the rest of the household. Your approach should be similar to
a good teacher: friendly manner, yet maintain control over the situation.


It is important to take into account the age of the child or adolescent you
are interviewing and adjust your behavior and interaction accordingly.
Although all children develop at different rates, age is a good guideline for
maturity level. For the CDS-II, all of the children we interview will be at
least 5 years old, and most, if not all, are in school. About half of the
children and adolescents will be 12 years of age and older. There will be
about 8% who are 18 or 19 years of age.



**Be Neutral, Don’t**
**Judge Others’**
**Way of Life or**
**Parenting Style**


**Tell Primary**
**Caregiver What**
**You Will be**

**Doing**



As with all interviews, it is important to leave your judgments at the door
when you enter a household. Sometimes this is more difficult to do when
children are involved since many people have very definite and strong
views about the right and wrong way to raise a child. It is important to be
accepting of everything in the household, even if it is not what you would
do with your own children.


Let the primary caregiver know what you will be doing and what you will
need at the time when you make the appointment.


This is probably the most important and useful thing you can do - tell the
primary caregiver that you will need to interview each child one at a time
in a quiet place away from any distractions and other people in the
household. Enlist the primary caregiver’s support in finding a suitable
place to do the interview and assessments, and in setting up the interview
times so that each child or adolescent is at his or her best during the
interview.


Spend a little time talking with the primary caregiver and let her know
what the different portions of the interview are all about. Everyone knows
that their own child is exceptional, and it is natural for parents to want to
be in the room while their children are being interviewed. If possible, ask
the primary caregiver to let you interview the child in private to make sure
the child can focus completely on the tasks. Always leave the door to this
room slightly ajar, have the child sit with his or her back to the door, and
encourage the primary caregiver to ‘peek in’ frequently. This dispels any
fears or apprehensions that primary caregiver may have about letting their
child be in a room alone with an unknown adult.

**Schedule the**

**Interview at the**

**Best Time**


**The Interview**

**Table for the**

**Interview**



Because it is important that each child is interviewed, be sure to ask
specifically about appointments the children may have (sports practice or
games, lessons, etc.) when you make the appointment. If one of the
children will only be in the household for a part of the time, you may need
to adjust the order in which you administer the individual interviews to
make sure that you complete the assessments, diaries and interviews for
each child.


TV and radio is a distraction to most people, but for some families it is on
all the time and used for background noise. If that is the case, it may be
best not to ask to have the TV turned off since the quiet may be more
distracting to the child than the ‘normal’ TV sounds. If the TV is on and
the child is trying to watch it while doing the test, ask to have the TV
turned off.


Ask the primary caregiver about the household schedule and suggest times
for an interview so that everyone will be home and at their best. People
tend to be less attentive and less patient when they are hungry or tired, so
try to avoid interviewing right before meals. Most school-aged kids have
very busy schedules and numerous lessons, activities, clubs, etc. after
school, so be aware that you will have to plan the interview around these
schedules. Enlist the primary caregiver's help in determining the best time
to interview each child.


Although you need a quiet place to interview the child or adolescent, do
not go into a room alone with a child and close the door. Leave the door
part way open and tell the primary caregiver that it is all right to ‘look in’
at any time. If, for any reason, the primary caregiver insists on being
present, that is acceptable. The primary caregiver must stand or sit behind
the child, out of his or her view. The primary caregiver may not make any
gestures or noises. Explain to the primary caregiver that any reactions
from her will distract the child and negatively affect the interview's

accuracy.


Also, try not to use the children’s bedrooms. The children’s rooms will be
filled with toys and belongings, and the child will be easily distracted.
Other places in the home may be equally distracting, especially for older
children and adolescents. Avoid places with televisions, computers, cell
phones, etc., and use your best judgment about the most appropriate place
to conduct the interview.


There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting a place to interview.


  - Try to eliminate distracting items (e.g., toys, games) from the area.

  - Arrange the table and chairs so that the child’s attention will be
focused on you and the materials. Because the door to the room
you are interviewing the child in will always remain open, you
should have the child’s back facing the doorway. Try to seat the


142


**Other Children**

**Present**



child catty-corner from you.

  - Have all your materials arranged so the interview runs smoothly.
Children can become easily distracted if you have to keep looking
for your materials.


You may want to engage the other non-participating children in an activity
while you are interviewing another child or adolescent. The primary
caregiver can be a great help to you in keeping other children occupied, but
if necessary, you may want to give younger children paper and pencil to
draw to keep them occupied. You may have to be fairly direct with
inquisitive children who are not being interviewed and ask them to go in
the other room until you are finished. If they are going to be interviewed
later, assure them that they will get their turn soon. Enlist the primary
caregiver’s help if the situation becomes difficult.

**Introduction**

**to the Study**



Do not touch the child for any reason at any time while you are in the
household. If necessary, enlist the primary caregiver’s help when measuring
the child's height and weight, or for repositioning the child for a better view of
the Woodcock-Johnson assessment easel.


When you are speaking to a younger child, make sure you lower your body so
that you and the child are at, or near, the same eye level. It is best if you squat
down to be at eye level. If you cannot do this, due to physical reasons, that is
acceptable.


When speaking to an adolescent, maintain eye contact as you would if
speaking to an adult.


It is important for the children to feel at ease with the Interviewer and the
interview setting before starting. Some children and adolescents will warm up
to you very quickly. Others will take a few minutes of chatting before they
settle down.


Always greet the child by smiling, saying hello, and introducing yourself. Ask
the child questions about activities, hobbies, pets, toys, school, or favorite
games or TV shows to get them talking about things with which they are
familiar.


It’s a good idea to ask the child or adolescent if he/she needs to use the
bathroom or needs something to eat or drink before you start the interview.
Any breaks taken before the interview begins will make the process go more
smoothly.


It’s good to say a few sentences about the types of questions you will ask of
the child. Make sure the child or adolescent knows that there are no right or
wrong answers to any of the questions. We just want to know his or her
thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Also explain to the child that his/her answers are
confidential, which means that no one else will see his/her answers.



**Pace Yourself** You will be in the household for a long time, and interviewing children is one
of the most tiring and demanding types of interviewing there is. To keep
yourself from getting too fatigued, take a small break between interviews.
Stay upbeat and positive throughout the testing time. Children and adolescents
will respond to the atmosphere that you create.



**Keep the Child**
**or Adolescent**

**on Task**



Children, especially young children, can be difficult to test and control. Here
is a list of things you can do to help keep the respondent on task:


  - Repeatedly refer to and touch the child’s response booklet.

  - Use positive and encouraging words. Make sure you praise the child


144


**Things to**
**Avoid**


**Things to be**
**Aware of**



equally for right and wrong answers, but don’t overdue the praise so
much that it appears insincere. Try not to encourage the child during
the middle of a set of questions. Some children may take a statement,
such as ‘good job,’ to mean that they got the question correct. As a
result, children may change their remaining answers due to your
encouragement. If you feel you need to say something during the
middle of a set of questions, only say neutral phrases like “That’s fine.”
Between sections of the questionnaire, use positive and encouraging
words tailored to the child or adolescent's age such as:


`o` “Good job”
`o` “You are really pointing well”
`o` “That’s exactly how to play this game”
`o` “You are really good at pointing to pictures”
`o` “You are really good at this”
`o` “You’re doing a lot of thinking”
`o` “You are really listening”
`o` “I like the way you are listening”


  - Some children will also get bored with the task. Try to gauge whether
they are tired or just bored. If they seem bored, try to encourage them
that the test or section will be over soon. If they are tired, take a break
after a section.


Always **avoid** statements that refer to the child’s progress on the test. Do **not**
use statements like “You got that right,” “No, that is not right,” or “Are you
sure?”


Also, be very careful not to give any facial expression or movement of the
head that may indicate that the child has gotten an item right or wrong. The
child will always look at you to check their progress especially if they are
unsure about their answer. **Avoid** any expression that would give them
feedback on their progress.


Be aware of your facial expressions and other nonverbal language. Children
are very receptive to nonverbal cues. Try to convey a positive, comfortable
message in general. Make sure your nonverbal language is not tied to
questions or the child’s responses.


Be aware of the mood of the child during testing. Some younger children will
get very tired and just start pointing to pictures. If the child seems to be
getting tired, take a short break (5 minutes) between the tests and let the child
get up and move around the testing area or get a drink of water. Do not break
during one of the sections, only between them. Try not to let the child leave
the space where the test is, they may not come back.

**Adolescents**


**Communication**

**Strategies for**
**Adolescents**



**PART C: WORKING WITH ADOLESCENTS**


Working with adolescents can present special challenges above what you
can normally expect when working with younger children. Adolescents are
somewhere between being children and adults. Each adolescent is at a
different stage of development, regardless of his or her chronological age,
and each may act more or less mature depending on the particular
circumstances of your interaction. You may find that some adolescents are
much easier to interview than young children while others present more
resistance than their younger siblings.


In this study, interviews with adolescents will take considerably longer than
interviews with younger children. Therefore, it is especially important for
you to gain the adolescent's cooperation and trust in order to make the
interview go smoothly and as quickly as possible. It is helpful to keep a
few things in mind to ease your interviews with adolescents.


1. Address the adolescent directly as if you were speaking to an adult.
As you get to know him or her, take into account the adolescent's
development level and adjust your interaction accordingly.


2. Respect his or her privacy and confidentiality, as you would with all
respondents, especially during the ACASI portions of the interview.
Explain confidentiality and consent clearly.


3. Withhold judgment. Remember that adolescents may "try on"
different personal styles which adults might find unusual or
offensive and that this is a natural part of development.


4. Be honest and straightforward with the adolescent during the
interview.


5. Give the adolescent control over some portion of the interaction.
You may need to negotiate with him or her as you would with an
adult rather than simply directing behavior as you would with a
child.


6. Remember that all adolescents are different. Some reluctant
teenagers may open up right away, some may not trust you until the
second household visit, and a few may never trust you.

**PART D: SPECIAL SITUATIONS WITH CHILDREN AND**

**ADOLESCENTS**



**If the Primary**
**Caregiver Asks to**
**See the Results of**

**the Assessments**



Primary caregivers often ask how their child 'did on the test.' The
assessments will not be scored until they are returned to the central office,
so you will have to tell the PCG that you do not have the results. Let them
know that we will not have individual data available, but we will send the
results of our study as a whole when our final data are available (in 1-2
years).



**Shy** If a young child is very shy (hiding behind the primary caregiver’s legs
and obviously uncomfortable with strangers), you may need to interview
the child while he or she is sitting on the primary caregiver’s lap. This is
acceptable, but you will need to ask the primary caregiver not to coach the
child in any way or try to help with the interview.


**Unresponsive** If the child does not respond to a question, wait 10 seconds and then repeat
the question. If the child still doesn’t respond or says ‘I don’t know,” ask
the child to make his/her best guess. You can say, “It’s all right to guess,”
or "I only want to know how YOU think or feel." You can also let the
child know that you understand the questions are difficult.


**Distracted** You should have freed the interviewing area of distracting items and made
it so the child’s back faces the door. Hopefully, this will cut down on the
amount of time a child is distracted, but we cannot always interview
children in the ideal environments and some children are easily distracted.
If you find yourself trying to interview a ‘distracted’ child, here are some
things to try:

            - Use positive and encouraging words.

            - Repeatedly refer to and touch the child’s response booklet.

            - Make sure items on the table, except the child’s response book, are
out of reach of the child.

            - Politely remove any distracting toys or objects from the child and
put them out of the child’s sight.

            - Take a break.

            - If these fail, you could try interviewing the child later during your
visit.


**Tired/Frustrated** Try taking a break (stretch, drink of water). If a break doesn’t help, try
interviewing the child at a slightly faster pace. Some children may appear
tired when they are bored with the pace of the interview.


**Overactive/Hyper** If the child is squirming or moving around, let the child know that he or
she needs to be seated with feet still to do the interview. If he or she talks
off the topic, then politely guide him or her back to the questionnaires.


147


**‘Response Set’** Some children give the same answer for every question or the same pattern
of answers for several questions, such as 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, etc. If this
happens, you can try encouraging the child with positive statements or try
taking a break. If the child answers you before you finish a question say,
“(CHILD), I want you to listen to me read the question, then you will have
your turn to answer.”



**English as a**
**Second Language**



Before conducting the interview, determine if the child speaks and
understands English well. If they do not understand English at all, then
they cannot be tested with the English language assessments or interview.
Arrangements may be made to administer the Spanish assessments and
interview to such children. Consult your Team Leader if you believe this
is necessary.



**Disabilities** Always check to see if a child should be wearing a hearing aid, glasses, or
other device that helps them to see, hear, or respond to questions. Most of
the assessment measures require pointing. If a child is unable to point, it is
acceptable for them to describe their answer to the Interviewer. If a child
is unable to speak, they can point. Any hearing, visual, or physical
impairment that may affect the testing situation should be noted in the
Interviewer notes.



**Suspected Child**
**Abuse**



If you see what you believe to be child abuse, report it to your Team
Leader. If, for any reason, you do not feel comfortable with that, you can
contact the Study Management Staff (their phone numbers are on the front
cover of this manual). The study has a system in place to take appropriate
action. You should not threaten the parents with being reported or do
anything in the interview situation that would lead the parent to believe
that their confidentiality is being threatened. Remember that we have
signed a confidentiality pledge that protects the information that they give

us.


If a situation escalates to physical violence while you are in the house,
excuse yourself and leave the home. Do not put yourself at risk at anytime
during the interview. You should also **not** comment to the primary
caregiver about any action (slapping in the face, hitting, etc.) that occurs in
your presence. If you have any questions or concerns regarding an
interview, please call your Team Leader or the Study Management Staff,
and we will do our best to resolve the situation.

**PROCESS**

TOC



**PART A: SPECIAL CDS INTERVIEWING PROTOCOLS**



**Sequence of**
**the**

**Instruments**

**and PCG**

**Priority**



Although there is a recommended order in which the various portions of the
interview can be completed, the Interviewer and the CDS family have a great
deal of flexibility to determine the most convenient way to complete the
interview. As the Interviewer, you should consider the unique characteristics
of each CDS family when planning contacts, appointments, and administration
of each part of the interview. There are several guidelines that must be
followed when setting the order for the interview:


The Coverscreen **must** be completed first, usually over the phone.


The PCG Permission Forms and Child Interview Assent Forms **must** be
completed before the child is interviewed. It is recommended that you attempt
to obtain signatures on the Teacher Permission Forms and School Information
Forms at this time, as well.


Adhere carefully to all rules outlined in this manual concerning mode of
administration for all portions of the interview. Be certain to take these rules
into account when planning how you will complete each household. For
example, the child interview **must** be completed in person; the PCG interview
may be completed over the telephone if that is more convenient.


While all parts of the interview are important, the most crucial are the PCG
Blaise modules. Therefore, you should place a priority on completing the PCG
interview including the Coverscreen, one PCG Blaise interview for each CDS
child (Sections A-H), and the PCG HH section (completed once for the
household). Even if permission is denied to interview the child, or if the time
diaries or OCG questionnaires are not filled out, the information from the PCG
Blaise interviews will still be useful to Study Staff.


Beyond those guidelines, it is up to the Interviewer and the CDS family to
decide the most convenient way to complete all portions of the interview.


Because there are several instruments to be administered in each household, we
expect that each household may take between 2.5 hours and 5 hours to
complete depending on the number and ages of targeted children in the
household and whether another caregiver is present. It is likely that for many
households you will need more than one household visit to complete all
portions of the interview.


A rule of thumb is that the age of the CDS children in the household largely
defines the amount of time it takes to do each piece of the interview and
determines the number of contacts (visits or telephone calls) it takes to
complete the household interview. Two examples follow that illustrate this
point and recommend approaches to scheduling time with different types of
families.


151


**Prioritizing**
**Elementary**
**School Aged**
**Children**



Example 1: A family with one CDS child under 8 years of age can probably be
completed in one household visit. This is because the child will only
participate in the assessments, not the Blaise interview, and the PCG interview
is shorter for young children.


Example 2: A family with a CDS teenager may require a combination of a
telephone call and a household visit. The PCG interview will be longer for the
part regarding the teenager than for a younger child, so it may be more
convenient to do that portion on the phone. In order to accommodate this, the
Interviewer could send the PCG Respondent Booklet, the time diaries, and the
OCG questionnaires to the household and then conduct the PCG interview by
telephone prior to the household visit. The child Blaise interview and
assessments must be completed in person and will also be longer for an older
child. Therefore, the Interviewer could spend the bulk of the household visit
conducting the child interview as well as reviewing the time diaries and OCG
questionnaires. A family with two CDS teenagers would take even longer and
would probably involve an additional household visit.


If you have any questions about how best to complete an interview with a
specific CDS family, consult your Team Leader to discuss the case and
possible solutions.


Because the CDS interview contains several different parts conducted with
different members of each family, and because each family will have different
scheduling and interviewing needs, it is important to keep some priorities in
mind as you organize your work and plan during production.


One important priority during the course of production is interviewing families
with elementary school age kids (aged 5-11 years) early in the study. The
reason for this is so that we can get the teacher permission forms signed and
returned to Study Staff in time for them to contact the child's teacher before the
school year ends. This means that we have a goal of interviewing all
elementary school age kids in the study before March 1.


Achieving this goal will require Interviewers to do a balancing act of
prioritizing elementary school age kids while still working with some of the
adolescents. You should avoid leaving all your adolescent cases until the end
of the study. Adolescents will be the most time consuming respondents to
interview, the most difficult to schedule, and the ones more likely to give
passive resistance.


SurveyTrak will be a useful tool to aid you in prioritizing your sample
according to child age. Child age for each child in the household will be
displayed in columns on the SurveyTrak main screen, so you can easily
examine your cases and sort them according to this factor.


152


**Team**

**Interviewing**



The milestone dates for production are:


- Elementary school age kids (5-11 years) -- 100% complete by March 1st

- Entire study -- 80% complete by March 15th

- Entire study -- 100% complete by April 30th.


In order to reduce the household burden and to avoid break-offs and
rescheduling, under certain circumstances interviewing teams may be created
to complete households with more than one targeted child. Team Leaders will
be responsible for creating teams where needed and coordinating their work.


Guidelines for team interviewing are as follows:


- In areas where sample density supports two or more CDS Interviewers,
team interviewing will be planned for households containing two CDS
children.


- Team Leaders will review sample assignments and, if needed, create
interviewing teams of two Interviewers per team. Team Leader will notify
interviewers as to which cases are to be attempted using a team approach.


- The Interviewer to whom the case is assigned in SurveyTrak will then flag
the SID for team interviewing in the main screen "Team?" column in
SurveyTrak.


- The Interviewer to whom the case is assigned in SurveyTrak will be the
lead Interviewer for that case. The lead Interviewer is responsible for
making initial contact with the household, completing the Coverscreen and
coordinating appointment schedules with the second Interviewer. The lead
Interviewer will also be responsible for the Interviewer observations and
should complete the thumbnail sketches in cooperation with the second
Interviewer.


- Once in the household, interviewing tasks will be divided between the two
Interviewers in whatever manner allows for the most efficient use of time.
For example, if both children in the household are available, one
Interviewer can do the Blaise interview with one of the children, while the
other Interviewer can do the assessments with the other child. Then they
can trade off and do assessments with the first child and the Blaise

interview with the second child.


- For cases that will be completed by a team, as with all cases, try to
complete the PCG Blaise interviews over the telephone to minimize the
amount of time that must be spent in the household. This will be especially
important for households in which there are two children 10 years and
older since the interviews for older children tend to be longer.


153


**Spanish**
**Language**
**Interviews**




- If the team cannot complete everything for a case in one household visit,
think carefully and consult with your Team Leader about how best to finish
the case. It is probably not necessary for both members of the team to
return to the household for a second visit. If at all possible, the lead
Interviewer should make every effort to complete the case alone.


- Should the need arise to conduct both child Blaise interviews at the same
time, the second Interviewer can access the child Blaise interview by
following these steps:


1. In SurveyTrak, bring up the Supplemental CDS job.
2. Create a sampleline in the Supplemental CDS job.
3. Interview the second child on that new sampleline.


If needed, this procedure may also be used so that the second Interviewer
can conduct both child Blaise interviews on the secondary laptop while the
lead Interviewer conducts the PCG Blaise interviews on the primary
laptop.


- If the household composition has changed, and the case turns out to have
only one CDS child, the interview will be done by a single Interviewer
instead of by the team.


- If scheduling conflicts make it impossible for both Interviewers to be at the
home when the respondent is available to do the interview, the interview
should be done by a single Interviewer. Notify your Team Leader if a case
flagged for team interviewing is done by just one Interviewer.


There may be some CDS families in which Spanish is the primary and
preferred language spoken at home. We have identified the families that are
potential cases for Spanish language interviewing based on the language in
which the 2001 PSID interview was done. These cases will be assigned to
bilingual Interviewers. If you are not a bilingual Interviewer and have any
respondents for whom the use of the Spanish language would provide a more
accurate interview, contact your Team Leader so that arrangements can be
made to conduct those interviews in Spanish.


We expect that most CDS children will be fluent in English and will be able to
complete the entire interview in English. However, in the event that a child
does not speak enough English, we will not do the child Blaise interview, but
we will do the assessments in Spanish. Contact your Team Leader if you
believe that a CDS child should do the assessments in Spanish.


It is more likely that the PCG and OCG will prefer to conduct their interviews
in Spanish. We will conduct the Coverscreen, PCG interviews, time diaries,
and OCG questionnaire in Spanish, and will have the study brochure,
permission forms, and letters in Spanish as well. These Spanish instruments
will be ready shortly after data collection begins.

Language preference for each household based on the 2001 PSID interview
language will appear on the SurveyTrak main screen (1=English, 2=Spanish,
7=Other).


If you have a case with Spanish language preference indicated in SurveyTrak,
follow these steps:


- Contact the household and determine if the PCG, OCG, and/or child
requires a Spanish language interview.

- If you are a bilingual Interviewer, make sure you have the introductory
letter, brochure, WJ-R easel and all necessary paper forms and
questionnaires in Spanish. If you need help obtaining these items, contact
your Team Leader.

- Make the appointment for the household visit and conduct the interview in
Spanish with those respondents who require it and in English with those
respondents who prefer that. The child Blaise interview must be conducted
in English. If the child is unable to complete the Blaise interview in
English, do not do this portion of the interview.

- If you are not a bilingual Interviewer, contact your Team Leader so that the
case can be assigned to a bilingual Interviewer.


Interviewers will have a hot key - CTRL-L - in Blaise that will allow them to
switch between English and Spanish if needed.


Incentives will be paid by check for most respondents. Payment will be
generated automatically through the Respondent Pay system in SurveyTrak. If,
for any reason, the Interviewer needs to pay the respondent in cash, there will
be a place in SurveyTrak for the Interviewer to record payment.


**PCG Incentives**


The primary caregiver will receive a check for $75 once all the PCG Blaise
interviews for that household are completed. This includes the Coverscreen,
one PCG Blaise interview for each CDS child (Sections A-H), and the PCG
HH section (completed once for the household).


**Child Incentives**


Each child will receive a check for $20 once his or her assessments (including
height and weight measurements, WJ-R and WISC Digit Span) are completed.


After you conclude the household visit, make sure to go back into the case and
complete the Interviewer Observations. This should be done as soon as
possible after you have left the household while the visit is still fresh in your
mind. Do not complete the Interviewer Observations in the presence of any of
the respondents.


155


The Interviewer Observations questions are from the HOME Scale, a widely
used instrument that assesses social and environmental influences on children's
and adolescents' development. These measures are based on your observations
as an Interviewer in the home. These questions are an integral part of the
information we gather from the household, so we ask that you please give each
item careful though.


There are two sets of Interviewer Observations questions:


1. The first set of questions is about your observations of the PCG's
interactions with each CDS child. There will be one observations block
for each PCG interview completed; these blocks will be labeled **PCG**
**OBS 1**, regarding Child 1, and **PCG OBS 2**, regarding Child 2.


2. The second set of questions is about the household in general and
should only be completed once for each household; it is labeled **HH**
**OBS** .


Blaise will create the appropriate number of Interviewer Observations blocks
for each household. A household with two CDS children will have a total of

three observations blocks; a household with one CDS child will have two
observations blocks. The Interviewer Observations blocks will be created after
the Coverscreen is complete, but you should wait to do them until the other
parts of the interview have been done. The entire case cannot be coded
complete until all of the interview observations are complete.

**PART B: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**


**General Review** A short overview of the Interviewer's tasks for this project was presented in
_Section 1: Introduction to the Study_ . In the following pages, you will be
provided with a detailed description of these tasks and the procedures for
administering them.



**Before the**

**Study Begins**


**Receive and**

**Review**

**Materials From**

**Ann Arbor**



The Study Specific Training will help you learn the basic procedures for
this study. You will receive your study supplies and field manual prior to
the training session. Be sure you have thoroughly reviewed this manual and
understand the concepts and procedures required of the project.


In addition, it may be helpful for you to review portions of your General
Interviewer Training manual to review administrative procedures and other
topics before data collection begins. If you are unsure about any procedures
or concepts, be sure to review them or confirm them with your Team Leader
**before** you begin interviewing.


Organize your materials and verify that you have everything you will need
to complete your interviews successfully.


Although the data collection period might seem to be quite long (October April), it is crucial and expected that you begin your assignment as soon
after training as possible. A quick start to production interviewing will help
solidify the concepts and procedures you learned during training.


You will receive your Interviewer materials and enough supplies for each of
your cases in a separate package sent from Ann Arbor. Please see the Bulk
Materials list in _Section 12: Field Notes_ for a full list of supplies in this
package. The package will also include the paper CDS instruments:


  - Permission slips that **must** be signed by the Primary Caregiver prior
to administering the child interview.

  - Permission slips for children aged 8 years and older that must be
signed by the child prior to administering the child interview.

  - Permission slips that must be signed by the PCG to allow ISR to
contact the child's teacher.

  - Information forms that must be filled out by the PCG to allow ISR
to gather public information about the child's school.

  - Child Assessment Booklets (one booklet for each child targeted).

  - Child Respondent Booklets (used in conjunction with the Child
Blaise questionnaire for children aged 8 years and older).

  - Weekday Time Diaries (one for each targeted child).

  - Weekend Time Diaries (one for each targeted child).

  - Primary Caregiver Respondent Booklets (used in conjunction with
the PCG Blaise questionnaire).

  - Other Caregiver Questionnaires (one should be filled out by the
OCG for each child targeted if there is an OCG in the home).

157


**Pre-Contact**

**Letters**


**Contact the**

**Household**



When you receive these materials, review them thoroughly to make sure
you have everything on the enclosed packing list. If items are missing, you
can send an e-mail request to the Field Interviewer Supplies email group at
. Please see _Section 13: Field Notes_ for more
details about requesting supplies.


When you are ready to begin work on a case, send a pre-contact letter and
brochure to the household before you contact the household to schedule the
interview. The letters will be provided for you in your bulk materials and
will remind respondents that their family has participated in CDS in 1997
and ask for their participation again. The letters will let respondents know
that an Interviewer will be calling them to make an appointment for a
household visit to conduct the interview with the primary caregiver and the
CDS children. The pre-contact letter will hopefully smooth the way for
your initial telephone contact with the household.


It is a good idea to allow two weeks for the letter to reach the respondent or
to be returned.


Send pre-contact letters in the #10 franked envelopes you have been
provided in your bulk materials. These envelopes have the University of
Michigan return address. Also be sure to fill in your interview
identification number and write "CDS" on the envelope. This information
is critical to enable Study Staff to contact you in case your pre-contact letter
is returned to Ann Arbor.


The Household Coverscreen includes questions that need to be answered
when you call the household to set up an appointment for your interviews.
(You can review these items in _Section 2: SurveyTrak, Blaise, and_
_Coverscreens_ .) The key things you will do during this call include:


  - Identify yourself (your co-Interviewer if applicable) and the study.


  - Determine who is the primary caregiver and if applicable, who is the
other caregiver.


  - Describe the household interview session including the child
interview and assessments. Discuss the need for a quiet place to
conduct the interview.


  - Let the primary caregiver know the expected length of the visit. If a
household has only 1 target child then the household interview
length is between 2 and 2.5 hours; if a household has 2 target
children then the household interview length is between 3 and 5
hours. The length of interview also depends on the age of the child.
The entire interview will be about 2 hours if the child is under 8
years of age; the interview is much longer for adolescents.


  - Set an appointment for the household session ensuring that all the
targeted respondents will be available.


158


**Respondent**

**Prepare**
**Materials for**

**the Case**




  - Balance the portions of the interview that must be done during the
household visit with those parts that may be completed over the
telephone. When scheduling an appointment for a household with a
child 10 years or older, try to set an appointment to interview the
PCG over the telephone. If you are going to interview the PCG over
the phone, be sure to send the PCG Respondent Booklet ahead of
time.


  - Explain time diaries. It is very important that you fully explain the
time diary over the phone to the primary caregiver. It will save you
a lot of time and hassle if the time diaries are correctly completed
for the selected days when you arrive at the household.


  - Explain the OCG questionnaire.


  - Verify the address and indicate that you will send a packet in the
mail.


One of the most valuable tools available to you in contacting and tracking
respondents is the Respondent Profile. The Respondent Profile for CDS
will be available in SurveyTrak where it is also known as an eProfile.
eProfiles for CDS will contain information from the 2001 PSID interview
including the date of interview; CDS children in the household, their ages,
and their relationships to the head of household; other household members,
their ages, and their relationships to the head of household; and perhaps
most importantly, the thumbnail sketches from the 2001 PSID interview.
You should review the eProfile for each case before contacting the
household so that you are well prepared for the circumstances and
respondents you will find there.


Step 1. Prepare the interview packet and send it to the respondent prior to
your interview. Each household packet should contain:

  - A Household Introduction Letter with the primary caregiver's name
and the selected child(ren)'s name(s) and interview time filled out

  - Two child time diaries (one weekday and one weekend day) per
child with the child's first name and selected dates filled in

  - OCG questionnaire for each CDS child with the child's name filled
in.


Step 2. Prepare your materials for the face-to-face interview and put them
in an expanding file folder that holds all materials for one household:

  - Fill in the child(ren)'s names on the permission forms

  - Fill in the child(ren)'s names on the assessment booklets

  - Bring along the respondent booklets for the PCG and child
questionnaires

  - Bring extra copies of blank time diaries and OCG questionnaires
just in case

  - Bring pencils, tape measure and weight scales.


159


**Visit the**

**Household**



When you visit the household for the interviews, you will take your bag
with the following items in addition to the Interviewer materials described
above:


  - Folder with paper materials listed above for this case

  - Laptop computer with case and headset for ACASI

  - WJ-R easel

  - Tape measure

  - Weight scale

  - 2-3 pencils

  - Blank paper

  - Post it notes

  - Extra brochures

**Edit Booklets**

**and Report**
**Progress**


**Send**

**Materials to**

**Ann Arbor**



As soon as possible after the household visit, **edit all the materials** from the
household session if needed. When the questionnaires and time diaries are
finalized, place them along with the permission slips into an envelope and
send them immediately to Ann Arbor. Notify your Team Leader that you
have completed a household and report whether the household had an OCG,
how many children were interviewed and their ages.


The purpose of editing is to make sure that the data you recorded in the
questionnaires are clear to the coders and the study director. When you edit,
remember that someone who was not present when you took the interview
needs to understand the written answers.


Take adequate time to review the questionnaire and make sure that the
recorded information will make sense to the coder. If you realize that you
have missed a question or there is a conflict, **CALL THE RESPONDENT**
**BACK IMMEDIATELY** . It is better to call the respondent back
immediately, while the interview is still fresh in the respondent's mind.


There are some general tips that you can keep in mind while editing.


Please check that:


  - All entries are **legible** .

  - All probes and other remarks you made during the interview are
indicated in parentheses and recorded where they occurred in the
interview.

  - All responses to open-ended questions are edited.

  - All checkpoints and skip instructions were followed correctly.

  - All ambiguities or inconsistencies in the respondent's answers are
marked with a marginal note and cross-referenced in the Thumbnail
section.

  - You have completed all items in the Thumbnail and provided detailed
information where needed.


When you have completed all components of a household interview, you will
need to send back the paper forms to Ann Arbor. This packet should include
the following items:


  - Time diaries (2 for each child)

  - OCG questionnaires (1 for each child as needed)

  - Permission slips as needed for each child

  - Child assessment booklet (1 for each child)


In order to ensure that no items are lost in mailing, the components of the
household interview should be sent to Ann Arbor via UPS. The tracking
number for each package should be recorded in SurveyTrak on the Control
tab in the View/Edit screen.

**Scheduling**



**PART A: PREPARATION FOR INTERVIEWING**


The CDS Team is made up of a large number of people working together in

different roles to make the study a success. We have designed your training
to make sure that you are knowledgeable, confident, and well prepared as an
Interviewer to collect high quality data. We are committed to supporting you
in this task during the field period and are always available to provide help.
Your responsibilities include active participation in training, meeting the
Interviewer production expectations, and asking for support when you need it
from your Team Leader, Production Coordinator, Regional Field Manager,
Survey Manager, or Study Director.


After training and prior to the start of production interviewing, all

Interviewers are required to pass a certification interview. It provides
confirmation that you have learned the necessary skills for interviewing.
Below are the certification requirements for all CDS Interviewers.


 - All Interviewers will complete one scripted certification interview with a
Team Leader in a round robin group. This interview will begin at Study
Specific Training with the face-to-face portions of the interview, such as
the child assessments, child Blaise interview, time diary and OCG SAQ
review. Certification will continue after training with a PCG Blaise
phone interview with a Team Leader in a round robin group.

 - Certification interviews will be evaluated through a review in WebTrak
along with observational feedback provided by the Team Leader
conducting the scripted interview. Written evaluation will be optional.

 - The Interviewer will not be released to begin production interviewing
until the evaluator of the certification interview completes this review and
determines that the Interviewer has met the necessary quality expectations
in conducting the interview.


Note: Additional certification interviews may be required at the Team
Leader’s discretion.


While you are waiting for the formal feedback on your certification interview,
begin to review your sample assignment in SurveyTrak. This is also a good
time to carefully review the information provided in the Respondent Profiles.
This information will give you an opportunity to get to know your sample and
begin formulating some ideas on approaches that may be successful.


Your work plan should be based on meeting the required production goals.
Knowing in advance how you will attack your assignment will maximize
your efficiency and cost. Organize your sample so that you can work in large
blocks of time, whether that is on the phone or traveling. Map out the most
efficient way of traveling to your household visits. Review of the
Respondent Profiles will help in your planning and scheduling of the cases
you will begin working first.


165


**Letter to**

**Authorities**


**Safety in the**
**Field**



In your materials we have provided you with a letter you need to deliver to
the local police stations, the Better Business Bureau, the Chamber of
Commerce, etc., alerting them to our presence in their area. It is very
important to do this before you begin your production activity. Suggest to the
local authority that they file the letter under “University of Michigan” and not
“ISR.” Too often, ISR is confused with IRS. If additional information is
requested, please notify your Team Leader. Your Team Leader may also
provide you with ideas about where to send letters.


Your safety in the field should always be a top priority. Be aware of your
surroundings and use good judgment about your safety at all times. If you
become concerned in any situation, leave it at once. Please refer to your
General Interviewer Training manual for tips on safety in the field.



**Materials** There are two CDS mailings to your home containing most of what you will
need for the study. Additional materials will be provided at training. The
first mailing, which you already received, contained a Welcome Letter, this
Field Manual, the Pre-Study Workbook, and the Refusal Conversion Booklet.
The second mailing will contain all of your bulk materials described below.


**Bulk Materials** Prior to the training, you will receive in the mail some of the materials you

will need to begin interviewing for the Child Development Supplement.


The following is a list of paper questionnaires you will receive:
 Time Diaries
 Other Caregiver Questionnaires
 Child Assessment Booklets
 PCG Respondent Booklets
 Child Respondent Booklets


Other materials:
 Materials Checklist

**PART B: CONTACTING RESPONDENTS AND TRACKING**


**Introduction** The success of this study depends on locating and interviewing every
respondent. High response rates, along with quality data, are necessary to
maintain the integrity of the study and researchers’ ability to apply the
findings to the general population. Each respondent is extremely important
and is representative of thousands of others who live in the United States.


In addition, CDS and PSID are panel studies that interview the same
respondents again and again, so it is crucial that we reach each respondent
who was interviewed for CDS in 1997. CDS-II respondents were also
interviewed for PSID in 2001. Information from previous CDS and PSID
interviews will be valuable to you in your efforts to contact respondents.


This section of the manual will give you specific guidelines to follow that will
assist you in locating lost respondents.


**Non-Response** People are becoming more reluctant to participate in surveys. Losing the
representative nature of the survey due to high non-response is something that
is taken very seriously—the validity of the study will be challenged if we
experience a high percentage of non-response.


We must identify the reasons that respondents are reluctant to participate, but
it is difficult to tease out the issues that play a part in non-response. The more
detailed information we can gather about the circumstances of our
uncooperative respondents, the better we can make adjustments that will lead
to greater success in future waves.


While non-response is a critical issue for all studies, it is even more so with a
panel study. Meaningful results are only possible when we are able to
observe the same people over a long period of time. If we fail to retain a very
high percentage of our respondents, we jeopardize our ability to observe real
change, and become unable to provide the information CDS was designed and
funded to address.


After being interviewed multiple times, respondents may question our need to
interview them again. It is essential that we listen to and tackle every concern
expressed by respondents. We need to fully explain why we conduct panel
studies and the importance of their continued participation; although their
situation may not have changed, the circumstances of other people’s lives
have. Only by combining their answers with others’ can we establish a broad
picture of how the country as a whole is changing. In addition, it may be
helpful for you to point out that the CDS interview is different from their
regular PSID interview because it incorporates interviews of children as well
as the adults in the family who are normally interviewed during PSID.


168


**First Steps for**
**Contacting**
**Respondents**
**and Tracking**



The first step, of course, in contacting your respondent is to call the phone
number listed in the sample information in SurveyTrak. (If the phone number
has "9's" in the last seven digits, the respondent's phone number is unlisted; if
the phone number has "0's" in the last digits, our records indicate that the
respondent does not have a phone.)


Working numbers should be called at varying times of day and on different days
of the week before proceeding to the next step. Phone numbers that are not
usable need to be documented as disconnected, wrong numbers, not in service,
etc. Even if a phone number you try for the family is incorrect, you must record
this incorrect number in the Call Record.


Verify from your telephone book that the area code is correct.  Many areas have
new or added codes; try to get the new area code with base number (the local 7
digit telephone number).


Once it has been established that the respondent is no longer at a number that we
have, and that other family members do not have an address or number, the
Interviewer should follow these steps:


--Call the Contact Person
--Call the Contact Persons previously given
--Call Directory Assistance

for the respondent's name and/or spouse's name
for the same last name

for CP's names as needed
--Call other possible leads from the eProfile

former roommates and other friends
former spouses, girlfriends/boyfriends
named nursing homes, trailer courts, etc.
employers
--Call in Ann Arbor for additional
information from past coversheet summaries if necessary.


A contact person may know more than he thinks he does. If the contact person
does not know the telephone number or address of the respondent, by all means,
troll for any other information he may have:


--Do you know to what area the respondent has moved?
--Might he/she be using some other name?
--Is there anyone else, such as a mutual friend or coworker, who could contact
him/her?
--Do you know where he/she works?


A finder's fee may be offered when you believe that it will help to get an address
or telephone number for a respondent, or if you believe that a finder's fee will
encourage a contact to persuade the respondent to get in touch with us. You
may offer $5 as a finder's fee. If you feel that $10 would be more useful, or it
has been paid in previous years, ask permission from your TL, and document
carefully the amount offered, and to whom. Remember that finder's fees will
not be paid unless the interview is successfully completed, even if the finder


169


**Next Steps for**
**Tracking**


**Face to Face**

**Tracking**



gave us accurate information that led to locating the respondent.


First review the call notes to make sure that no possible leads have been
overlooked. If not, pursue the following:


--Send a respondent letter to the last known address, requesting that the
respondent call the 800#.


--Send a letter to the last known address, marked:

**Do not forward**
**Address Correction Requested**


This "endorsement" needs to be at least 1/4 inch below the return address, and
printed, preferably in a contrasting color, such as red. If a forwarding address is
available, the postmaster will mark it on the envelope and return it to you. [A
letter request will need to be completed and the letter will be sent. This process
can take a couple of weeks, so while waiting...]


If the respondent is likely to have been receiving benefits from the Social
Security Administration, check the Social Security Death Benefits Index. This
computer disc is available in most large libraries, and lists anyone for whom
death benefits have been applied. It will also give the county and zip code
where the last benefits were received.


There are also several Internet search sites that may be helpful in tracking
respondents. Be sure to get approval from your RFM before proceeding with
tracking on the Internet.


If none of these efforts succeed, the case may be tracked in person. Work
closely with your TL in deciding what course to follow in field tracking, as field
efforts can quickly become costly. You may:


--Visit the last known address, and talk to neighbors on both sides and across the
street. Ask neighbors for names of a landlord or rental agent.


--Talk with the landlord, building manager, or realtor.


--Ask at local stores, bars, churches, or schools.


--Talk with letter carriers, delivery persons, or Meals on Wheels.


--Visit local, county and state government offices.


- **Town clerk:** In a small town, the clerk may be helpful in providing address
information from city services, such as trash collection.


- **Chamber of commerce:** Again, a good source in a small town.


**Local library:** Cross-reference or "crisscross" directories, allow you to find a
phone number if you have an address, and you can also find numbers for
neighbors. This service is not available in all areas.

**-Voter Registration:** Election records of registered voters, often available on
computer, usually need date of birth.


**-Motor vehicle registration:** This may be called Depaitment of Motor
Vehicles. Not available in all states. May list vehicles owned, and address.


**-Drivers license bureau:** May also be called Depaitment of Motor Vehicles.
Not available in all states. Will need date of bi1th, or at least a close guess at the
age--some clerks ai·e more helpful than others. Usually a f **e** of $3.00 or so.


Rich source of inf01mation
**-County appraiser's office, or local tax assessor:**
about prope1ty ownership and tax records. A good way to find a landlord, when
you are seeking a renter, or to find a mailing address for absentee prope1ty

owners.


**-County recorder's office:** Look for maniage, biith, and death records.


**-Local utilities** (water, sewer, trash collection)


**-Sheritrs office**


**-Local office of Department of Health and Human Services:** Ask to speak to
the respondent's caseworker, who can relay a message to the respondent. (A
social security number will probably be needed. Since CDS does not have a
social security number, give the naine and the last known address of the
respondent.) A caseworker may not give out the respondent's address or phone
number. Hint: Do not contact caseworkers the 29th of the month to the 3rd of
the next month nor the 15th to the 18th of the month, or Mondays or Fridays, as
these are the generally busy times for them.


Again, cai·eful records need to be kept of all these effo1ts. Not all of these
sources ai·e available in all locations, and there is a chai·ge for some of them.
Sources should be cultivated, and thanks given for even a small ainount of
info1mation. A thank you note goes a long way towai·d building a good working
relationship.


When calling respondents, the objective is to make each contact as efficient as
possible and miniinize your tune on the phone or on the road during
unproductive times.


Using data from Call Notes, we have ranked the following tune slots
according to likelihood of finding someone at home:


**Preferred Contact Times**


**1** Most likely at home **Sunday -Thursday** **6pm-10pm**
**2** _,l,_ _,l,_ **Friday -Saturday** **6pm-10pm**
**3** _,l,_ _,l,_ **Saturday -Sunday** **9 am-6pm**
**4** Least likely at home **Monday -Friday** **9 am-6pm**

We have also identified the best and worst time slots for attempting contact:


**Best and Worst Contact Times**


Best **Monday** **7pm-9pm**
Worst **Friday** **9 am-12 am**


When you reach an infonnant who is having doubts about providing contact
infonnation about the respondent, identify the issue and respond to it. Do not
ove1whelm an info1mant with explanations. It is better to hold something
back so you have a reason to call again.


_I can understand your reservations about giving out information on a close,_
_personal friend without checking with him first. Why don't you contact Mr._
_Jones and I'll call you back in a few days?_


Remember, timing is eve1ything! Don't push an infonnant to the point he
f **e** ls harassed. If you sense he is f **e** ling pressured, back off. Let a few days
or weeks go by before you attempt contact again, especially if you sense that
he needs to contact the respondent before giving you any info1mation.


Chances are you will be talking to people who have a direct link to the
respondent, and to some who do not. Some infonnants may be suspicious,
question the legitimacy of our research, or perceive contact with you as an
imposition on their time. Dealing with infonnants requires preparation and
finesse.


The first step is to evaluate the situation and develop a strategy before you
pick up the telephone.

- What is the best introduction I can give?

How did I obtain the infonnant's name or agency name?

What are the most usefol questions I can ask him or her?

What questions or objections might the infonnant have? How will I

respond to them?


The Telephone Introduction:


In most cases, the Inte1viewer should introduce him or herself by establishing
credentials and the impo1tance of locating the respondent for valuable
research. If the infonnant asks, "How did you get my name or telephone
number?" The Inte1viewer should be prepared to answer the question without
hesitancy, in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. Below are examples of
appropriate responses to the question:


**If the informant was listed as a contact person:**

_The last time we spoke with Ms. Smith, she told us you were the one person r_


172


**Telephone**
**Messages and**
**Directory**
**Assistance**



_she knew would always know how to locate her._


**If contacting the informant was a suggestion of another individual:**
_A person I spoke with while trying to locate [respondent’s name] suggested I_
_contact you. The University of Michigan’s commitment to safeguard privacy_
_does not allow me to disclose that person’s name. Any information you_
_provide will also be confidential._


**If the informant’s name and telephone number was obtained through an**
**electronic resource:**
_We were able to determine you were a neighbor of [respondent’s name] in_

_[year] by your address. We understand this is an unusual request, but it’s_
_important to our research that we locate [him/her]. Any information you give_
_us will be confidential._


A word of warning about electronic sources: Do not volunteer that you have
obtained the name or number through an electronic source. Many people
have misconceptions about electronic sources being illegal or are
uncomfortable with the amount of public information that is electronically
available today.  In some cases, it may be best to start the conversation with
confirmation that you are talking to the resident of a particular address, rather
than confirmation that you are speaking with a particular person.


**Never underestimate the value of a telephone company message or**

**Directory Assistance Operator.** Directory Assistance permits two requests
per call. If you don’t know the specific city, but know an approximate area,
ask the operator to do a search for listings in the entire area.


If you have a telephone number for the respondent or contact person, call it.
You will probably get one of the following results. Record in detail the
telephone company’s message or the results from Directory Assistance.


1. The number has been **“disconnected.”** Listen carefully. **“Temporarily**
**disconnected”** may mean that the individual has not paid a telephone bill. If
you suspect that this could be the case, try the number weekly for at least a
month to see if the line is reconnected. A second possibility is the number has
been disconnected while an individual is on an extended vacation or at a

second home.


2. The number is **“being checked for trouble.”** This telephone company
recording may mean the line has a service problem. If you receive the
message several times, it may be an indication the customer has not paid his
bill. Try the number weekly for at least a month to see if it is reconnected.


3. The number has been **“reassigned”** to someone else. **Verify the telephone**
**number** you have called, including area code, with the new party.  If the
number is correct, ask if there has been an area code change since the date of
the respondent’s last interview. (There have been numerous area code


173


changes in recent years. The respondent’s area code may have changed, but
s/he may have the same seven-digit number.)


**Ask,** _**“How long have you had the number?”**_ Telephone companies usually
wait at least six months before reassigning a telephone number. The
respondent may be at the same address with a new non-published number.


If the person on the line has had the number longer than the time elapsed since
the respondent’s last interview, **there may be a data input error** . Check
previous wave Call Notes for typographical errors or a reversal of numbers.


4. The number has been changed to a non-published number. Call Directory
Assistance (don’t speak to a machine) and ask the operator for the respondent
at the specific address. If the operator says, “At the customer’s request the
number is unlisted and does not appear in our records,” ask for verification of
the address.


This message may be recorded but often continues with, “If you need further
assistance, please say yes now.” If you are disconnected before you have a
chance to ask for address verification, call right back. Tell the operator that
since the telephone number is unlisted you will have to write to the person
and **ask for her help in verifying the address.**


5. The number **rings more than 20 times, but is never answered.** Twenty
rings usually means the number is no longer assigned or that you have
reached a pay phone. After 20 rings on assigned numbers, you may get a
recorded message, “Your party is not answering, please try your call later.”
Verify with Directory Assistance or a contact person that the number you are
dialing is the correct number for the respondent.


6. **Calling the number produces a high pitched squeal** (possibly a fax or
modem). Verify the telephone number with Directory Assistance. Inquire
whether the respondent has two telephone numbers. If so, ask for the second
number. The Directory Assistance Operator may not know whether one of
the numbers is a fax line.


If Directory Assistance verifies that the number you have been calling is
correct and it is the only listing for the respondent, you should call in the four
call slots for at least two weeks. Many home fax machines are used on an
irregular basis.


If after the two-week period you still get the fax line, notify your Team
Leader. S/he may authorize that a letter be sent via fax.


7. **When calling the number, you get a message giving you a new**
**number.** Call the new number.


174


**Call Notes** Call Notes about a contact or attempted contact with a respondent are another
invaluable interviewing tool. **As the Interviewer it is your responsibility to**
**provide complete, relevant and useful information in the Call Notes for**
**each of your cases.**


Many people depend on the Call Notes to gain an understanding of the
interaction between the respondent and the Interviewer, which in turn is used
to make adjustments in future waves of the study.


Call Notes are also analyzed to provide insight into successful or unsuccessful
data collection efforts. They identify calling patterns that are most successful
both by region and by types of respondents. Areas of non-response can be
addressed by modifications in presentations of questionnaire content and
materials.


When you review the previous wave’s Call Notes, or thumbnail sketches,
think about what you wish had been recorded—what would have helped you
better understand your respondent. Then include that level of detail for the
next Interviewer in your Call Notes.


**What To Include In Call Notes**


The call notes should include information about the respondent, the
household, contact persons, and informants. This may include information
that you specifically ask for and things that you pick up incidentally.


**The respondent or informant’s name.** This is essential in making contact
with the correct person on the next call.  This can include nicknames, aliases,
or maiden names.


**Other personal information.**

        - relationship between the informant and the respondent

        - gender

        - age

        - marital status

        - name of spouse, partner, roommates or friends

        - last known address, telephone number, or employer

        - vacation homes and other residences

        - names of trailer courts, apartment complexes, and neighborhoods.


**All telephone numbers** that are used in trying to contact the respondent or
informants.


**What was said by the Interviewer.** How much and what kind of
information you gave to the respondent/informant.


**What was said by the respondent.** Note any concerns that were expressed
and whether or not your response seemed sufficient to allay the person’s


175


**Confidentiality**
**in Tracking**


**Letters**

**Request**



concerns.


**Action to be taken in future calls.** If an appointment was set, note the time
and date. Indicate whether this was a firm appointment or simply a suggested
time to call back.


**Other suggestions that might help get the interview.** The respondent’s
normal working hours or household routines that might interfere with
obtaining an interview (e.g., meal times, children’s schedules, etc.).


**Answering machine messages.** The first time you hear an answering
machine or recording, write a brief summary of the recorded message. Make
note of any changes to that message in the future.


**What NOT To Include In Call Notes**


**Judgmental statements.** Call notes should never contain judgmental
statements, which could be interpreted as damaging to the informant or
prejudicial to other Interviewers. Problems should always be documented in
an objective and neutral tone. If you are in doubt about how to record a
situation, consult with your Team Leader.


Interviewers must strictly adhere to the Institute for Social Research (ISR)
Policy on Safeguarding Respondent Privacy in tracking efforts _._


- Any information obtained during the interview with a respondent cannot
be used in the tracking process.


- Releasing an informant’s name, repeating information one informant gives
to another, or acknowledging an informant was unable to provide you
with information on the respondent is a violation of ISR’s commitment to
confidentiality.


- Under no circumstances should an Interviewer reveal the name of the
study or give a study fact brochure to an informant.


In addition, be very discreet when calling leads, especially employers or former
spouses. You certainly can and should identify yourself as calling from the
University of Michigan. If the person you are calling is a contact person given
by the respondent, you should tell him/her that the respondent gave us his/her
name as someone who would know how to reach him. If pressed by someone
through whom you are trying to reach the respondent, you may tell them that
the respondent is participating in a study done by the University of Michigan,
but do not identify the study.


You may encounter situations in which a letter from Project Staff to the
respondent would be useful in facilitating contact, persuading interview
participation, or for another reason.


176


You can request an 800-number letter if you are having trouble contacting the
respondent (if they have no phone or are screening their calls, for example).
The letter will ask the respondent to call in to the 800-number to let us know
how best to contact him or her; this information will then be passed along to
you, the Interviewer. Alternately, the 800-number staff may instruct the
respondent to call you at home if you provide your home phone number and the
best times for the respondent to call (this may also be set up as a collect call).
We often include some persuasion in these letters.


In the event that you contact a respondent who is reluctant to participate, and
your initial attempts at persuasion fail, a persuasion letter may be helpful.
Assign the case a _resistance_ result code and complete a Letter Request in
SurveyTrak. A persuasion letter should not be your first step in refusal
aversion/conversion, but do not wait to request at letter until resistance hardens
into a refusal. Your Team Leader can help you decide when it is an appropriate
time to send a persuasion letter or if other actions might be more persuasive.


You can also request a condolence letter if a respondent's family member has
died and you feel it would be appropriate for Project Staff to acknowledge the
loss and express sympathy to the surviving family members.


If you think that a letter sent from Project Staff to the respondent may be
helpful, you should discuss the case with your Team Leader first. If you and
your Team Leader agree that a letter is the best option, you can request a letter
in SurveyTrak. The request will need to be approved by your TL, who may
request additional information from you if needed. The request will then be sent
to Project Staff (who may also request additional information from you), who
will tailor the letter to fit the specific concerns or needs of the respondent. You
should wait at least 8 days after the letter has been sent before attempting to
contact the household again. Do not delay contact beyond two weeks or the
effect of having received the letter may be lost.

**PART C: PRODUCTION ISSUES**


**Staffing** The field staff structure for CDS is designed to promote an atmosphere of
**Structure** team spirit, diversity, and productivity with the focus on a national team
effort. This environment will allow flexibility in managing the sample and
providing the needed support to the Interviewers and to the project demands.
To accomplish this, the field staff will be divided into work groups each
headed by a Team Leader and including approximately 10 Interviewers.


The Team Leaders will work with the Production Coordinator,
, and the Regional Field Manager,, to manage
production during the field period.


In the Ann Arbor office, there are a variety of people providing overall
management and support of CDS, and working closely with the field staff.
Here is the Ann Arbor management team:


         - : Survey Director

         - : Survey Manager

         - : Research Assistant


The organizational structure just described requires cooperation and
interdependence. A major benefit of the field staff working closely with the
Ann Arbor staff is that we all gain the ability to understand, communicate
and implement the necessary project activities to better meet the goals and
challenges of the study.



**Interviewer**

**Commitment**

**Statement**



Each interviewer will be asked to sign a Commitment Statement at training
registration outlining standards for Interviewer training and job performance
while working on the CDS-II. The Commitment Statement will vary based
on your expected workload on the project. A copy of the Commitment
Statement will be provided to you at training.



**Production** Our overall national production goals for CDS-II are approximately 1947
**Goals** completed interviews with a response rate of 90%. Our average hours-perinterview or HPI goal is 14.6 hours.


The milestone dates for production are:


         - Elementary school age kids (5-11 years) -- 100% complete by March 1,
2003

         - Entire study -- 80% complete by March 15, 2003

         - Entire study -- 100% complete by April 30, 2003.


You will receive a cardstock copy of the national weekly production goals
that you should keep close by your work area. Refer to this production goal

chart and your work team goals as you monitor your progress during the
course of the project.


**If** you are not meeting the established goals, please work with your Team
Leader to make any adjustments that may be necessaiy to help you reach the
goals. You will find your Team Leader to be an invaluable resource
providing suggestions and encouragement based on their successful
experiences and "field-tested" methods.


Your Team Leader is always available as a resource. Throughout the course of
the study, you will have weekly pre-ananged contacts with your TL. To make
the most efficient use of your time on this call, be sme to have all of yom
materials and questions prepared prior to the call. These sessions ai·e desi gn ed
to provide you with the suppo1t you need. This includes reviewing yom
individual completion rates, answering questions, discussing strategies for
properly working your sample, and celebrating yom accomplishments!


You will need keep track of your cases in Survey Trak and repo1t your
progress to your Team Leader. **If** you have paitially completed the household
you should report which instmments have been completed, the number of
tai·geted children in each household and their ages, and whether or not your
household had an other caregiver.


In addition, it is extremely impo1tant that you send and receive in SurveyTrak
once per day in order to transmit your data and other infonnation to Ann
Arbor and your Team Leader and to receive any info1mation that the Ann
Arbor office or your Team Leader will send to you.


Your Team Leader, Production Coordinator, and Regional Field Manager ai·e
your immediate supervisors and should be your first contacts if you need
help. However, Data Services Staff in Ann Arbor ai·e available by phone or
email to assist and suppo1t you throughout production. Although we are
always available to help, you should contact Data Services Staff in particulai·
if your TL, PC, or RFM has inst [r] ncted you to do so or if you have an
emergency ai·ise in the field and your TL, PC, and RFM are unavailable.

**Expenses** & Send in your TEJs ~~[(]~~ Time and Expense Jomnals ~~[) ]~~ on a weekly basis. Failure
**TEJs** to comply makes it impossible to keep track of costs to the project, and may

be grounds for disciplina1y action. You will receive a Training Fee for all
training-related time that you spend on the project attending training,
reviewing materials and applications, and practicin the interview. The I
-------- [-] ' pro [j] ect number for production interviewing is _ [. ] _______ _
179


**Quality Control** There are a number of ways in which we monitor the quality of our data

collection efforts. Our definition of quality embodies many aspects ranging
from the interviewing team, the questionnaire and support materials,
performance of the questionnaire application, management of the sample, and
the data that is collected. We all share responsibility for the quality of all
aspects of the data collection process. Below are some of the specific
responsibilities that each of us shares in this process.


**Evaluation** Each Interviewer's Team Leader will evaluate the Interviewer's abilities
throughout the course of production. Formal evaluation will take place near
the beginning of production to ensure that each Interviewer has mastered the
skills necessary for the study. This evaluation will consist of two portions.


Taping: Each Interviewer will be required to tape record two PCG Blaise
interviews with the respondent’s permission. Interviewers must tape record:


         - one of their first three interviews and

         - one of the 5th-10th interviews that they conduct.


The Interviewer must complete a self-evaluation form for each taped
interview. The self-evaluation form and the tape should be mailed to the
Team Leader within 2 working days of completion. Interviewers should
indicate in SurveyTrak (in the View/Edit feature, Control Tab; see _Section 2:_
_SurveyTrak, Blaise, and Coverscreens_ for details) when the interview was
taped and mailed to the TL. TLs will provide the Interviewers with feedback
about the taped interview. The TL, PC, RFM, or survey management staff
may request additional taped interviews as needed.


Tapes should be labeled with the following information:
1. Sample ID
2. Project number
3. Interview number

4. Date of interview

5. Your ID number
DO NOT put the respondent’s name on the tape.


Review of Paper Instruments: Each Interviewer will be required to send to
their TL for review paper instruments from:


         - each of their first 3 interviews and

         - the second interview taped for evaluation - one of the 5th-10th interviews.


Paper instruments include the Assessment Booklets (Height/Weight, WJ-R,
WISC), Time Diaries, OCG questionnaires, and permission forms.
Interviewers should indicate in SurveyTrak (in the View/Edit feature, Control
Tab; see _Section 2: SurveyTrak, Blaise, and Coverscreens_ for details) when
the paper instruments are mailed to their TL. TLs will provide feedback and
extra instruction as necessary; additional review of paper instruments may be


180


requested as needed.


As with paper forms that are mailed directly to Ann Arbor, any paper forms
that are mailed to your TL for evaluation should be sent via UPS and tracked.
Enter the tracking number in SurveyTrak in the Control tab of View/Edit.
Your TL will evaluate your work and then send your paper forms to Ann
Arbor through the same mailing and tracking process.


**Verification** In accordance with ISR standard quality control procedures, a percentage of
interviews from each Interviewer will be verified. Verification will involve
calling the PCG back to confirm the interview and will be conducted by a
centralized verification team in Ann Arbor. The Interviewer should advise
respondents that someone from the central office might be calling them to
confirm their interview.



**Respondent**
**Payment**


**Respondent**
**Receipts**



Whenever you have respondent payment issues, such as a check that cannot
be cashed by the respondent, you MUST submit an Electronic Respondent
Payment Form via SurveyTrak in order for the request to be processed. It is
essential that we maintain a “trail” to account for all transactions that relate to
the payment of incentives to the respondents. See _Section 2: SurveyTrak,_
_Blaise, and Coverscreens_ or your SurveyTrak manual for details about
submitting payment requests.


Cash payments for face-to-face interviews are often an effective tool for
getting the interview on the spot. There are also occasions where a
respondent cannot cash a check from us. We have provided Respondent
Payment Receipts (green half sheet) in your bulk supplies. **If you pay out-**
**of-pocket to your respondent, you must get a signed receipt form and**
**submit that with your TEJ for reimbursement.**

**If you're keeping the laptop to use on another project:**


Do Nothing. Leave the project open on your laptop. After the project is out
of the field and the Data Control staff has checked everyone's sample, the
Team Leaders and RFMs will be info1med that the project may be removed
from the laptops. Your Team Leader will notify you to close the project on
your machine at that time. _It is very important to leave the project open_ until
then, in case the Data Control staff needs some info1mation from your laptop.


**If you will be shipping the laptop to Ann Arbor:**


When an Interviewer te1minates or has finished work on a project and will not
be assigned to another project for 3 or more months, it is the responsibility of
the Regional Field Manager, Production Coordinator, or Team Leader to
make arrangements for the return of equipment.


183


Step 1: You should contact the RFM, PC, or TL to coordinate the shipping of
the computer. Final sample reconciliation must be done at this time.


Step 2: The RFM, PC, or TL will inform the Help Desk staff that you are
ready to return the machine and a Help Desk call will be opened.


Step 3: Data Control staff will reconcile study control files, update the Help
Desk call as needed, and notify the RFM, PC, or TL that the machine may be
shipped.


Step 4: The RFM, PC, or TL will contact you and instruct you to ship the
machine. You should ship the computer as is. Do not close any projects on
the machine unless otherwise instructed by Data Control staff. Please refer to
the attached shipping instructions.


Step 5: When the machine arrives in Ann Arbor, the Help Desk call will be

October 2002 - April 2003


**l**



The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research is requesting your family's participation
in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement. This study has become
one of the most important studies of its kind, providing insights on the various ways in which the
family, school, and neighborhood affect children's and adolescents' development. \Ve have enclosed
a brochure that describes the Child Development Supplement in more detail. We hope that after
reading about the value of this study, you will permit an interviewer to talk with you and your family.


The study is desi gn ed to collect information from the children in your family who participated in the
1997 Child Development Supplement, and the parents or prima1y and seconda1y caregivers of these
children. An interviewer will be contacting you by telephone, if possible, in the near future, to set
up an inte1viewing appointment. As a small way of showing our appreciation for your family's
contribution to the CDS, we would like to give the primary caregiver $75 for an interview. We
would like to give each child who participates $20 for his/her own contribution. _**The interview is**_

_**completely voluntary, and the info.cmation you provide will be held in stn"ctest confidence.**_


The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research is a national research organization whose
reputation is based on over fifty years of inte1viewing people about issues of national importance.
We take elaborate measures to ensure each participant's privacy and confidentiality. Each of our
professional inte1viewers is required to si gn a yearly Oath of Confidentiality. Results of this study
are reported only in statistical form, which will not permit any identification of individuals
participating in the study.


If you have any questions about the Child Development Supplement, please do not hesitate to call
our toll free number - . We appreciate your consideration and look forward to
talking with you soon.

Thank you for agreeing to pa1ticipate in the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics. It is funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. We
will gather info1mation on how financial and social resources in the home, community and school affect
children's health and achievement. This info1mation will help researchers learn how our nation's children
are fruing over time.


On the date below, the Inte1viewer you recently talked with will come to your home to inte1view you,
your children who ru·e eligible for the study, and the other cru·egiver (i.e., the person who helps you care
for your child or children). The name of the other caregiver and each child chosen for an inte1view is
listed below. It is important that each child listed is present on the day of the inte1view at the scheduled
time.


The Time Diruy your Inte1viewer mentioned is enclosed with this letter. Please note that there are two
Time Dia1y booklets for each child listed below. Each booklet should be completed on the day specified
on the front cover. We appreciate your taking the time to carefully complete the booklet on each d [a] y
specified.


Also enclosed is a questionnaire for the other cru·egiver to fill out. **If** more than one child has been
selected for the study, there will be a second questionnaire for the other caregiver. Please ask this
person to fill out the questionnaire(s) before the inte1view appointment. The Inte1viewer will pick up
the completed mate1ials at the time of your inte1view.


In appreciation for your pruticipation in our study, we will send you a check for $75 when your
inte1view is completed. Each child who pa1ticipates will receive a check for $20. Your Inte1viewer has
pledged to protect your p1ivacy. Any info1mation given in your inte1view and in your time diaries will
be treated complete! confidentially. **If** you have further questions, please don't hesitate to call us at our
###### toll free number, -----

Sincerely,



_**�NP�**_

RESPONDENT DEFINITIONS

**Primary Caregiver:**



**CDS-II RESPONDENT DEFINITIONS**



The Primary Caregiver is the main respondent for this study, and will be completing the
Coverscreen, signing permission forms, helping you schedule interviews with the child,
completing an interview about the child (the “PCG-CHILD” instrument) and about the
household environment (the “PCG-HH” instrument), and in some cases, completing the time
diaries for or with the child. By definition, the PCG **must live with the child** .


In most cases, the **PCG** will be the **child’s biological mother** . If the biological mother is not
living with the child, the appropriate respondent is the first person on the following list who lives
with the child:


1. Stepmother, Adoptive mother, or Foster Mother


2. Other female **legal** guardian (Must be at least 18 years of age)


3. Father (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)


4. Male legal guardian of the target child


5. **Final preference** is to take the interview from the person living with the child who
is an adult (at least 18 years of age or older) and takes primary responsibility for
caring for the child. This might be another relative such as a grandmother or aunt.
This does not include someone who is paid or hired to take care of the child (i.e., not
a babysitter or nanny).


We have preloaded the likely PCG based on data from CDS-I (1997) and the 2001 PSID core
interview. It is important to verify who the PCG is because that person may have changed since
we interviewed the family last. Do not make assumptions about the identity of the PCG – the
Coverscreen will guide you through the selection process.


If the primary caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the Interviewer will administer
separate sets of instruments for each child.


**Other Caregiver:**


Once you have determined who the actual PCG will be for this study, you will ask the PCG if
there is an Other Caregiver in the household and who that person is. Again, you may need to
help select the Other Caregiver by order of preference. The Other Caregiver must be living in
the Household Unit. Please note that once someone is selected as the Primary Caregiver he/she
can be selected as another respondent as well. An example would be if the there were two sisters
living together each with their own child. They would both be primary caregivers to their own
children and other caregivers to their sister's children if there was no one else in the household
unit that better fit that description.


The order of preference for the Other Caregiver is as follows:


1. **Father** (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)


201


2. **Grandmother** of the target child


3. **Boyfriend or Girlfriend** of the primary caregiver


4. **Other Relative** of child who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in the HU. If
there is more than one in the HU, choose the person who has the most responsibility
for taking care of the target child.


5. **Other Non-relative** who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in the HU. If there
is more than one in the HU, choose the person who has the most responsibility for
taking care of the target child. This should not be a paid employee (i.e., not a
babysitter or nanny).


The Other Caregiver **must** be over 18 years of age for all definitions.
