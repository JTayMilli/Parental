# The Child Development Supplement
## Panel Study of Income Dynamics

### Wave II

### Time Diary Activity Codebook

October, 2003


#### **Time Diary Module for the CDS-II**

The Child Development Supplement 2002 (“CDS-II”) data collection utilized the same interviewing
procedures and coding protocols for the time use module as the first wave of the study. With the older
age-range of the children in the CDS-II (ages ranged from 5 to 19 years), the activity codes were
somewhat expanded to capture more detail for participation in community, school, and active leisure
activities. Codes were added to the “organizational activities” group to include participation specific
types of helping organizations and detailed extracurricular school clubs and organizations. CDS-II added
details to the “sports and active leisure” group to capture specific sport or recreational activity.

In order to accommodate these new detailed codes but also allow for easy mapping back to the CDS-I
data, CDS-II created a four-digit activity code whereby the first three digits reflect the 1997 code. The
fourth (last) digit is a “0” for any code that remained identical to CDS-I code. If the code was expanded
to capture more specific detail, a sequential number beginning with “1” was added as the fourth digit.

Here is an example: In CDS-I, activity code “801” was defined as “football, basketball, baseball,
volleyball, hockey, soccer, field hockey”. In CDS-II, each specific sport was coded separately: “8011:
football”, “8012: basketball”, “8013: baseball”, etc.

This modification to the code scheme allows the researcher to capture more specific detail for CDS-II but
at the same time, provide opportunity to “roll up” the codes to the 1997 activity codes.

Other code categories from CDS-I remained the same in CDS-II to permit comparisons across waves.
