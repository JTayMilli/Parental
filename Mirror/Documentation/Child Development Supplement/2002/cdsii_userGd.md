## Chapter 1 – An Introduction to the CDS

The Child Development Supplement (CDS) is one research component of the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal study of a representative sample of U.S. individuals and the families in
which they reside. Since 1968, the PSID has collected data on family composition changes, housing and
food expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment, income, time spent in housework, health,
consumption, wealth, and more.


While the PSID has always collected some information about children (see the PSID bibliography for research papers on child development 1 ) in 1997, PSID supplemented its main data collection with

additional data on 0-12 year-old children and their parents. The goal of this new data collection was to
improve our understanding of the socio-demographic, psychological, and economic aspects of childhood
from a nationally representative longitudinal perspective. The CDS-I successfully completed interviews
with 2,394 families (88%), providing information on 3,563 children. In 2002-2003, CDS re-contacted
families in CDS-I who remained active in the PSID panel as of 2001. CDS-II successfully re-interviewed
2,019 families (91%) who provided data on 2,907 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years. In 2005, the
CDS piloted a specialized interview for cohort members transitioning into adulthood, aged 18 years and
older.


The CDS gathers a broad array of measures on developmental outcomes across the domains of health,
psychological well-being, social relationships, cognitive development, achievement motivation, and
education as well as a number of measures of the family, neighborhood, and school environments in
which the sample members live and learn. The breadth and depth of measurement offers a substantially
rich resource to study development of children and teens alike from infancy/early childhood through
middle childhood and adolescence.


In addition to the survey measures described above, the CDS collects time diaries from the sample
children 3-18 years of age. These diaries provide a basic foundation for understanding how children
across ages, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status engage in a range of activities and social
circumstances. They additionally offer an excellent opportunity to investigate research questions that
examine relationships among time spent in various activities, aspects of the family environment, and
outcomes related to achievement, social and behavioral development, and health. The time diaries provide


By nature of the CDS being a supplement to the PSID, the study takes advantage of an extensive amount
of family demographic and economic data about the sample children’s family—not only parents, but also
grandparents, siblings, cousins, and other relatives—providing more extensive family data than any other
nationally-representative longitudinal survey of children and youth in the U.S. This rich data structure
allows analysts a unique opportunity to fully link information on children, their parents, their
grandparents, and other relatives to take advantage of the intergenerational and long-panel dimensions of
the data.

Through a separate biennial interview, data are further collected on sample members during their early
years of transitioning into adulthood, and in the main PSID when they leave home and become heads of
their own households. The extensive information collected on experiences during childhood and
adolescence can then be used to help explain patterns of adult life experiences and development. Truly,
the multi-level, multidisciplinary, and longitudinal nature of the combined PSID-CDS research design
make the CDS an important and very unique resource to the research community.

CDS-II User Guide Page 1


The goal of this User Guide is to provide you with detailed information about the overall CDS study
design, specific measures, data structure and relationships with the “parent study” – the PSID. More
specifically, the next chapter, Chapter 2, introduces the CDS-II data collection modules and their
relationship to the CDS-I modules. Chapter 3 describes the CDS-II sample and data collection response
rates. Chapter 4 follows with documentation on the sample weight and related issues. Chapter 5 provides
highlights of the data collection efforts, and Chapters 6-10 detail the goals and measures in each of the
modules – Primary Caregiver, Child, Assessments, Time Diaries, and External School modules,
respectively. Chapter 11 briefly lists the variables that were coded in the CDS-II. Chapter 12 is an
important chapter for CDS data users to review. This chapter provides information about the rich data
resources in the PSID main and supplemental files, the data structure within the PSID, and fundamental
aspects of its data structure as they relate to the CDS respondents. In Chapters 13-15, we continue with
more information on data structure and linking within the various data groups in the PSID-CDS Data
Center.

## Chapter 2 – Overview of the CDSII Modules

Both waves of the CDS collect measures of developmental outcomes in the areas of health, achievement,
and psychosocial wellbeing, and measures of inputs into development within the context of the child’s
family, neighborhood, and school. Due to the panel nature of the study, most measures in the second
wave duplicated those assessed in the baseline to permit analysis of change over time. The CDS-I User
Guide (Hofferth et al., 1999 [2] ) provides an overview of the initial wave and its measures. Changes in the
type and content of the instruments at the second wave largely reflected measurement needs related to
changes in the developmental stages of the children across the data collections. In CDS-I, almost all of the
participating children were 0-12 years of age, with a good number not yet in school. The interviews
focused on developmental issues appropriate to the infant, early childhood, and middle childhood stages
and emphasized contacts with caregivers and preschool /elementary school teachers. In CDS-II, almost
one-half of the CDS sample was in adolescence. We added substantially more youth-reported measures,
new adolescent-appropriate scales, such as the Adolescent HOME Short-Form Scale, and more
psychological and educational scales. Additionally, we expanded the interview with the children
themselves, and incorporated many of the new question items in an Audio-Computer Assisted SelfInterview (ACASI) whereby adolescents listened to the questions through a headset and recorded their
responses directly into the laptop. This method has been shown to improve data quality for reports of
sensitive information such as questions about psychological well-being, sexual behaviors, and
experiences with tobacco, alcohol, and drug use (Aquilino, 1994) [3] .


The CDS-II data are collected from multiple individuals using varied methodology, but all with a focus
on the sample child and his/her social and physical environment. The CDS interviewers are, as follows:
(1) Primary Caregiver Interview that focused on the child and household characteristics; (2) Child
Interview for children aged 8 years and older, including an Audio-Computer Assisted Self-Interview
(ACASI) component for sensitive topics asked of adolescents; (3) Standardized Educational Achievement
Assessments for all children using the Woodcock Johnson and WISC Digit Span Test; (4) Time Diary for
weekday and weekend accounts of use of children’s time filled out by either the child alone or the child in
collaboration with the mother; (5) Other Caregiver Questionnaire that focuses on the child and household
characteristics; (6) Elementary/Middle School Teacher questionnaire, that focuses on the child’s behavior
and achievement at school, characteristics of the classroom and the school, in general, and characteristics
of the teacher; (7) Course and Grade Reports of adolescents as one measure of academic choices and
achievement patterns (8) External School Database to gather information about the school and school
district environments. Table 2 below provides a summary of the content of the CDS modules. In this
chapter, we review the modules included in the second wave. Chapters 6-10 provide more detail about the
specific measures within each module, and Chapter 12 provides details on measures collected in the PSID
main family interview.

**Primary Caregiver Child Interview**


The Primary Caregiver Child Interview (“PCG-Child”) is the anchor to all other CDS modules
and required for a sample child to be considered “response” in the study. We considered it
“anchor” since it contained key developmental measures for the study, including almost all of the
HOME SF scale items and other family environment measures, the Behavior Problem Index,
parent-report on schooling and education activities, extra curricular activities, health, and child
expenditures and savings.


As in CDS-I, by definition, the PCG must have lived with the child to be considered a primary
caregiver. In most cases, the PCG was the child’s biological mother. If the biological mother was
not living with the child, the appropriate respondent was the first person on the list of
relationships below who was living with the child:


� Stepmother, adoptive mother, or foster mother


� Other female legal guardian (must be at least 18 years of age; oftentimes the
grandmother)


� Father (biological, adoptive, step, or foster)


� Male legal guardian of the sample child


� An adult (at least 18 years of age or older) who lives with the child and takes primary
responsibility for caring for him/her. This does not include someone who is paid or hired
to take care of the child (i.e., not a babysitter or nanny).

The variable RELPCG02 in the data center specifies the familial relationship of the PCG to child.
We are constructing a parallel variable for CDS-I – to be released in the winter of 2006.


We expanded the PCG-Child interview in CDS-II to include new questions about the sample
child’s experiences with asthma and asthma-related symptoms, extended items on family rules
and rule enforcement, extended HOME Scale items, questions about extracurricular involvement
in school, sports, and the community; and expanded questions directly related to parents’
economic and time investments in their children.


CDS-II User Guide Page 5


**Primary Caregiver Household Interview**


While the PCG-Child interview focused on the sample child, the PCG-Household Interview
(PCG-HH), in turn, focused on household characteristics (e.g., neighborhood, family rules) and
the PCG’s own psychological resources and social support, parenting values, stresses, and styles,
and beliefs about the parental role in child rearing. This module remained largely the same across
CDS data collection waves.

**Child Interview**


Children who were at least eight years of age and older were eligible to participate in an in-home
interview themselves. For the most part, the Child Interview was a new addition to CDS-II,
focusing on: self-concepts for reading and math abilities, school connectedness, peer
victimization and bullying, family relationships, electronic media use, work experiences (for
youth 12 years and older), and future expectations. The Eccles self-concept items for reading and
math and the self-esteem measure were the only measures in the Child Interview that were also
assessed in the CDS-I.

Children in the adolescent-stage additionally participated in an Audio-Computer Assisted SelfInterview (ACASI) component whereby the children listened to the questions themselves on a
headset and then responded directly into the laptop. Children 10 years and older participated in
Section K of the Child Interview that queried the youth about their hobbies and extracurricular
activities, characteristics of friends, and health behaviors such as dietary, exercise, and sleep
patterns. For youth 12 years and older, the ACASI module included items on the youth’s own
savings and expenditure patterns, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, delinquent behavior, educational
aspirations and expectations, parental monitoring reported from the youth’s perspective, and
languishing and flourishing.

**Assessments**


The assessments in CDS-II replicated those in CDS-I: physical measurements and achievement
tests. Interviewers collected height and body weight of the children, and administered
standardized educational achievement tests using the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Tests of
Achievement and the WISC Digit Span Test for Memory. Height and weight were gathered in
CDS-I in the primary caregiver interview, and the assessments were included in the “Child
Interview”. The physical and cognitive assessments provide important, high-quality outcome
measures for the study. More information about the assessment administrative procedures and
data quality are described in Chapter 8 of this guide.

**Time Diary**


The time diaries are one of the unique features of the CDS design. While the PCG and Child
interviews included stylized questions about the children’s structured and unstructured activities,
and activities with parents and absent parents, the time diaries provide detailed accounting of the
type, number, duration, and location of activities during sampled 24-hour days, beginning at
midnight for one randomly sampled weekday and one randomly sampled weekend day. Using the
time diaries, we additionally collected information on the social context of the activity by
specifying with whom the child was doing the activity and who else was present, but not
engaging.


Page 6


**Interviewer Observations**


After the in-home interview, the interviewer recorded observed interactions between the primary
caregiver and the child/adolescent, and characteristics of the physical environment of the home
and neighborhood. Most of these items are replicated from the HOME Scale Short Form, as used
in the NLSY79 and can be summarized in terms of cognitive stimulation and emotional support.
In CDS-II, we included additional observational items that were not a part of the NLSY79
version, but included in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods Study.
Observations are fully described in the appendix under the HOME Scale Specifications.

**Other Caregiver Child and Household Interviews**


CDS-II collected information about the sample child and home environment from a secondary
caregiver in the home (“OCG”), broadly defined as a second person living in the household who
had responsibility for raising the sample child. There has been substantial interest in the
involvement of fathers in the lives of their children. In many low-income households, however,
the second caregiver can often be a grandmother, not a father or partner. The expanded “OCG”
definition in both waves of the CDS permit examination of the contribution of a second caregiver
more generally over many other studies that just focus on the father. During data collection,
OCGs were identified for 2,009 CDS sample children (69%). The content of the OCG-Child and
OCG-Household interviews was drawn directly from the PCG interviews and remain largely
consistent across CDS data collections.

**School Data**


In CDS-II, we bolstered our data resources that focus on the school environment. These data were
designed to allow researchers to both model school level influences on child and adolescent
development and to control for school level influences when modeling family and neighborhood
level influences on developmental outcomes. We replaced the school administrator interview
from CDS-I with linkages to the National Center for Education Statistics Common Core of Data
(NCES CCD). The CCD provides access to a broader range of variables about the schools and
data at a high response rate than the CDS-I School Administrator surveys. Selected Variables
from NCES CCD that contains information about the school that the CDS sample child attended
at the time of the CDS-II data collection (school year 20022003) were posted to the CDS Data
Group in the PSID-CDS Data Center. The variables we posted are a small sampling of data about
the school and school district environment that are available through the CCD
(http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/index.asp). Some examples of the data we have selected data are school
type, racial/ethnic composition, pupil-teacher ratio, completion rates, and expenditures per child.
Sensitive data contracts are available for the school and school-district linkages for the sample
children.

In CDS-II, we added a module that asks middle school and high school students about school
courses to obtain detailed information on educational progress and achievement. These data are
planned for release in 2006.

**Looking Forward: Following the Full CDS Sample into Adolescence and Young Adulthood**


Almost ten years ago, the CDS sample was selected from all PSID families with children 0 to 12
years of age. At the second wave of CDS, almost one-half of the sample had aged into
adolescence. In 2007, the remaining younger half will be in adolescence. We plan to collect a
third wave of CDS data at this point, using much of the same measures as used in the CDS-2.


CDS-II User Guide Page 7


During CDS-II, we observed a small number of individuals who had already turned 18 years. By
2005, the number of CDS youth at least 18 years and no longer in high school was close to 900.
These postsecondary school years have been recognized as ones with new developmental
opportunities and challenges as individuals’ self identities continue to evolve, future expectations
and goals further develop and begin to materialize, choices in how discretionary time is used and
invested increase, and investments in tertiary education and careers take root.

In 2005, with the growing proportion of CDS youth 18 years and older, we developed a new
survey module to capture data on young adult developmental pathways and outcomes, which
served a scientific purpose of continued collection of detailed information about development for
the sample, and data on the status of early adulthood markers (as collected in the PSID main
family interview for Heads and Wives). The interview domains coordinated with the CDS
adolescent measures, provided new questions critical to assessing development at this stage, and
linked into the adult status markers in the PSID on employment, income, and health. In 2007, the
CDS young adults interviewed in 2005 were reinterviewed, and CDS youth who had newly
turned age 18 and completed or left high school were also interviewed.

The table below shows the sample distribution of the CDS youth by age in upcoming PSID data
collection years. Cells shaded in green are the CDS Youth 10-17 years who will be eligible for
CDS-3, and cells shaded in light purple are the CDS Youth who will be eligible for the Transition
into Adulthood Interview. Note that sample size estimates account for family attrition from PSID
only up through 2003, but beyond that, and other individual-level attrition are not accounted for
in this table.

When the CDS youth become economically independent from their parents, that is, when they


Page 8


“split off” into their own households, they become eligible for participation in the main PSID
family interview, the point in the life course when the PSID begins to collect its most detailed,
long term information on the sample members’ adult health, family, work, wealth accumulation,
and more.

## Chapter 3 – The CDS Sample

Using sample weights, the CDS is designed as a nationally representative sample of children in
the United States. This chapter describes the initial sampling in 1997, the re-interview sample at
the second wave, and data collection response rates by module, sex, age, and race for the CDS-II.
Chapter 4 provides information on the CDS-II sample weight.

**The Initial 1997 Sample: CDS-I**


In 1997, the sample for the CDS was drawn at the time the 1997 PSID interviews. As interviews
were completed for the main PSID, family units with followable children under the age of 13
were identified for inclusion in the Child Development Supplement. Both the PSID core sample
and the new PSID immigrant refresher sample generated Child Development cases. Out of the
2,705 families selected for the CDS-I, 2,394 families (88%) participated, providing information
on 3,563 children. Households outside the continental U.S. were excluded from interviewing and
were coded as non-sample. All other households were included in the sample.

After the data were collected and prepared for release, it was determined that 83 of the 3,563
children were non-sample and not a part of the PSID. These children were kept in the CDS-I data
file for the purpose of cross-sectional analysis. At each wave of the PSID, when new information
is provided about the families, it is possible that we may find that other families and/or children
within families are not actually sample members. When this happens, the variables described
below are updated. If you are mapping CDS-child level data with family-level data in the PSID,
and using the data longitudinally, the variables described below, located on the PSID Individual
File, 1997, are very useful.

**Re-interview Sample in 2002: CDS-II**


For CDS-II, we essentially followed the sample children of CDS-I whose families were still
active in the PSID 2001 main study. Specifically, eligibility criteria for inclusion in the second
wave of CDS were, as follows:


� Response in CDS-I (n=3,563)


� Considered sample at the time of the main PSID data collection in 2001 (n=3,480)


� Family of the targeted CDS child still active in the PSID panel as of the 2001 main
interview. In-between 1997 and 2001, 94% of the CDS children had families who
remained active in PSID (n=3,271).


During data collection, there were some situations in which we did not attempt interviews with or
for sample children who met the criteria above. We attempted interviews for the CDS Sample
child if:


� Sample child still resided under the care of a primary caregiver (meaning, he/she
had not yet established own residence);


� Sample child lived in U.S.;


� Sample child did not reside on a military base; and


� Sample child was non-institutionalized.


CDS-II data collection resulted in completed interviews for 2,907 of the 3,271 “followable”
children in 2002-2003 who still met data collection eligibility, resulting in a response rate of 91%.
The reasons for not completing an interview during the CDS-II data collection are specified in
Table 3.4.

In the CDS-I PCG Child Interview (Question A6), the Primary Caregiver reported the sample
child’s race as: White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander,
American Indian or Alaskan Native. Using this variable, the distribution of CDS-II response to
the Primary Caregiver Interview in 2002-2003 is, as follows:

Table 3.3. CDS-II Response by Sample child’s Race

|Race|Total for<br>Age|Percent of<br>Total Sample|

|Total|2,907|100.0|



Out of the 2,907 response to the Primary Caregiver interview in CDS-II, 63.9% of the sample
children (n=1,857) had a sibling who also participated CDS-II.


CDS-II User Guide Page 13


**Data Collection Outcomes for the Individual Modules**


Each CDS sample child could have up to eight modules of data collected from three different
family members and a school resource. Eligibility for some modules depended on child’s age or
whether a secondary caregiver resided in the home for the child. Chapter 4 defines the modules
and eligibility in more detail. The table below provides an overview of data collection response
rates per CDS-II module.

*Contingent on participation in the Primary Caregiver Child interview.

In the CDS-II Demographic File, you will find a series of variables that identify the status of
individual modules. Each variable is coded to specify whether the sample child had a completed
interview for that module (“2”), an incomplete for that module (“5”), or the module was not
applicable for that child (“0”). PCG module response pattern for CDS-II by age is, as follows:

## Chapter 4 – The CDSII Sample Weight [4]

_Elena Gouskova, Ph.D., Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research_


As described in Chapter 2, in the first wave of the CDS, 2,394 families participated, providing
information on a total sample of 3,563 children. The second round of data collection took place in
2002-2,003 when 2021 families were successfully re-interviewed, resulting in total of 2,907 child
interviews. The reduction in the sample is due to reclassification of the eligibility status of a
number of 1997 sample participants and also due to nonresponse among the remaining eligible
CDS families. To account for differential probabilities of selection due to the original PSID
sample design and subsequent attrition, CDS data are provided with weights. This note describes
the process of the 2001 Child Supplement weight construction and discusses some related issues.


The chapter is organized as follows. Part Two provides information on the sample attrition
between 1997 and 2001. The Primary Caregiver/Child weight construction procedure is described
in Part Three. In Part Four, we discuss the complex structure of the CDS which consists of
several interview modules. In this section we highlight the issue of missing data for special
modules and suggest possible ways to deal with this missing data problem in the analysis of these
data.

**Part 2: Changes in the CDS Sample Between 1997 and 2002/2003**


Out of the 3,563 children with complete CDS-I interviews in 1997, information was gathered for
2,907 children in CDS-II during 2002/2003. The reduction in the sample comes from two
sources: the decision not to follow some families from the original 1997 CDS sample (292
children) and non-participation by eligible families in the 2002-2003 interview process (364
children). A summary of the sample size changes in the CDS panel is provided in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1. Sample Size Changes in the CDS Panel

Targeted in 2002 PCG interview: NO 364

PCG interview: YES 2,907

Subtotal 3,271

Total (1997 sample

size)


Prior to the 2002-2003 CDS data collection, a decision was made to follow only 1997 CDS
baseline families with children that had sample status [5] . Of the 3,563 children who participated in
CDS-I, 83 were“non-sample” according to standard PSID rules for longitudinal panel eligibility
for newborns and other new household members.


4 This chapter is from _PSID Technical Report: the 2002 PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS-II)_
_Weights_, written by Elena Gouskova (August 24, 2004).
_http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/questionnaires/cdsiiweights.pdf_

5 PSID respondents are distinguished as sample and non-sample members. Sample respondents are those
who belong to the original 1968 family for the core PSID sample or original 1997 family for Immigrant
sample. Sample members are also those who are related by blood or adoption to a PSID sample member.


CDS-II User Guide Page 17


The second eligibility criterion for CDS-II was that the family of the targeted CDS child needed
to be active in the PSID panel as of the 2001 main interview. Between 1997 and 2001, 94% of the
CDS children had families who remained active in PSID (that is participated in the 2001 PSID
biennial interview). Thus, the suspended portion of the sample consisted of families with nonsample children and families that left the PSID study before 2001. The total number of suspended
cases is 292, reducing the targeted sample of children from 3563 in 1997 to 3271 who were
eligible to participate in 2002/2003.


Starting with this sample, the CDS-II successfully obtained interviews with 2006 PSID families,
resulting in 2907 child observations. Accounting for both sources of attrition in the 1997 baseline
CDS-I panel, the CDS-II re-interview rate is 81.6%. Among PSID “sample” children determined
to be eligible for CDS-II re-contact, the interview completion rate for the primary care giver
(PCG) interview was 88.9%.

_**CDS-II Weight for Primary Caregiver (PCG)/Child Analysis**_

CDS-II, like CDS-I before it, includes different interview modules that are designed to collect
data from multiple “observers” that may be associated with each sample child. In CDS-II, these
“observers” always include the child’s primary caregiver (PCG) but may also include: 1) a
secondary care giver; 2) a teacher; and 3) the child herself/himself (both interview and test
assessment). The primary caregiver interview is the minimum data required to qualify as a CDSII case. Table 1 summarizes the eligibility and response outcome for the PCG interview.
Eligibility and response dispositions for the remaining CDS observation modules are summarized
in Table 4.2.

The CDS-II analysis weight described below pertains to the analysis of the PCG interview data.
Special weights are not provided for the analysis of the other CDS-II modules listed above.
Section 4 below provides guidance on how analysts may address the problem of missing data for
other child observation modules.


Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal
probabilities of sample selection and non-response or data that is missing at random (MAR)
(Little and Rubin, 2002) [6] . These weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each
observation is selected and conditional on selection that they respond to the survey questions.
With longitudinal data this joint probability at time t, where the study has started at t-1 or earlier,
can be expressed as following


P(St=1)=P(St-1=1)*P(Rt=1|St-1=1)

where St is an indicator of participation in a study at time t and Rt is an indicator of response at
time t. The probability of being a participant at time t is a product of probability of participating
in previous period and conditional probability of being a response in the current period. As the
first term on the right hand side of (1) is proportional to a reciprocal of weight in the previous
period, the weight in the current period is a product of the weight in previous period and the
inverse of probability of response (the second term on the right hand side of (1)). We will refer to
1/ P(Rt=1|St-1=1) as attrition adjustment factor.


Accordingly, the CDS-II weight is a product of CDS-I weight and the attrition adjustment factor.
The individual level Primary Caregiver/ Child weight ( CH97PRWT) was used as the previous
year weight [7] . To obtain the attrition adjustment factor, the probability that a sample person was
successfully re-interviewed in the CDS-II was modeled with the linear logistic model. As we
discussed above there were two different reasons for attrition. We modeled them together, i.e.
observations where a person was not interviewed included both suspended and non-response
cases [8] . The estimates of the logistic model are given in Table 4.3.

Sons, New York.

7 For the description of the 1997 CDS weights construction see
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/weightsdoc.html

8 We experimented with separate modeling of the two types of attrition. The results turned out to be very
similar.

Summary statistics

N: 3563

As the final step in the weight development, the newly constructed CDS-II weights for Primary
Caregiver/child observations were censored to reduce the influence of extreme weights on the
variances of sample estimates of population statistics. One percent of weights at the top and

th st
bottom of the distribution were assigned values of the 99 and 1 percentiles respectively.


To check the 2002/2003 CDS-II PCG weight we compared weighted estimates for some basic
demographic, geographic and socio-economic variables in 1997 (weighted by the 1997 CDS-I
weight) to the same estimates for the smaller CDS-II re-interview sample (weighted by the CDS

Page 20


II weight). The results of this comparison are provided in Table 3.4. The comparison of weighted
estimates for the baseline CDS-I and follow-up CDS-II suggest that the CDS-II attrition
adjustment factors included in the PCG/Child analysis weights are compensating for potential
attrition bias in the family type and demographic composition of the CDS panel data. Note: This
comparison does necessarily not rule out the possibility of spurious or more subtle forms of
selection bias that may not be associated with the demographic, geographic and socio-economic
characteristics of CDS respondents.

The final CDS-II weight is stored in the variable CH01PRWT. The CH01PRWT weight should
be used for analyses involving child level data or data involving the relationship of the child with
their PCG or with family characteristics.


The Primary caregiver/ Child weight, CH01PRWT, can be converted into a caregiver level
weight by averaging the weights for each CDS-II child observation provided by a caregiver. This
PCG/family weight could be use to develop an analysis that is focused on the caregiver or their
family as the unit of observation/analysis.

_**Addressing Missing Data in Other CDS-II interview Modules**_

The CDS-Interview has a complex structure involving several modules. These modules are the
Primary Caregiver (sections A-H, J), Child Interview, Child Assessment, Secondary Caregiver,
and Elementary School Teacher Interview. The Primary interviews form the core data collection
of the Supplement. Completion of these interviews determined whether an observation is
included in the final data set or not.


CDS-II User Guide Page 21


Thus for all children in the CDS data set the Primary Caregiver interview were responses.
Response /nonresponse the Primary caregiver interview was also an indicator for attrition in
calculation of the CDS-II attrition adjustment parameter described in the previous section.

Other CDS-Interview modules are secondary to the Primary Caregiver module and may or may
not have been successfully completed. It is possible to have information on the Primary Caregiver
interview and have missing data for any of the secondary module interviews. It is important to
note that all secondary interviews, except for the Child Assessment interview, had an additional
eligibility condition. For example, the Child Interview was administered only to children ages 8
or older. Thus missing data on the secondary interview with eligibility condition can be due to
two reasons: non-response or ineligibility.


When accounting for the eligibility restrictions, the response rate to the secondary interviews is
generally lower than the response to the Primary Caregiver interview. The case counts by
eligibility and response status for each secondary module are given in Table 4.2.


Researchers interested in analyzing the CDS-II data for the secondary modules should carefully
examine the extent of the partially missing data problem and address it if necessary.


The issue can be approached in a number of ways. The simplest way is to assume that the data are
missing completely at random (MCAR). That is, given the adjustment that has already been
performed for attrition in the CDS PCG observation sample, non-response to a secondary module
is completely random with respect to the dependent variables of interest. When MCAR is the
appropriate assumption, analysis of the observed data for the secondary modules will not lead to
biased estimation. The MCAR assumption, however, is too strong and may not always be a good
approximation for an attrition process. For example, our preliminary investigation indicates that
for the Child Interview, age was an important factor in participation decision. The younger
children tend to be more likely to participate than older children. If the probability of nonresponse
can be modeled as a function of observed variables such as age or gender, Little and Rubin (2002)
describe the missing data mechanism as missing at random (MAR).


When the nonresponse or missing data mechanism is MAR, one can approach the problem by
either imputing the missing values or constructing additional weighting adjustments using
procedures that take into account variables (such as age in the above example) that predict the
probability of a response. Analysts who are interested imputation of missing response data for the
CDS secondary modules may wish to review Raghunathan et al. (2001) [9] and access the
corresponding SAS-compatible imputation software at http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/smp/ive/.
However, since the missing data problem for CDS-II secondary modules typically involves
complete missing data for all variables, analysts may choose to develop a weighting adjustment to
compensate for an MAR missing data mechanism. The algorithm for constructing these
weighting adjustments should be similar to the one described above in Section 3 for the
PCG/Child. Here, the logistic regression model of response propensity would be estimated based
only on characteristics of eligible respondents and nonrespondents, excluding cases that were not
eligible for the given module (see Table 4.2). The new attrition adjusted weight would be
constructed as the product of the individual weight (CH01PRWT) and reciprocal of the estimated
probability of response in the secondary interview.

## Chapter 5 – Data Collection Procedures

The data collection for CDS-II is generally described in this chapter. More specific details on
administration of assessments, anthropometric measures, and time diaries are described in each of
their individual chapters that follow.


Data Collection for the CDS-II began in October of 2002 and extended through May of 2003. We
employed 119 interviewers on the study who were extensively trained in all aspects of general
interviewing techniques and study-specific data collection procedures, including unique protocols
to administering the Woodcock Johnson tests of achievements, measuring height and weight,
conducting the HOME Scale home and neighborhood observations, administering time diaries,
and working with children of all ages. Approximately two-thirds of the interviewers had already
worked at least one field study at the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan prior
to working on CDS.


CDS employed a mix-mode interviewing approach to increase flexibility in scheduling
interviews. As mentioned in Chapter 2, each CDS sample child could have up to eight modules of
data collected from three different family members (primary and secondary caregivers; sample
child) and a school resource (teacher and/or school administrative data). The PCG interview was
designated as the priority interview, and could be administered in-person or over the telephone, at
the convenience of the respondent. The other interviews could be juggled depending on the
respondent’s schedule (OCG, Child, PCG household) and could be conducted in different modes.
Time diaries and other caregiver interviews could be administered in-person or over the telephone
but had the added option of self-administration. Child interview components (assessments, height
and weight measurements, and child CAPI/ACASI interviews) were conducted in-person.

Participating families received between $95 and $115 for their contributions to CDS, depending
on the number of CDS sample children in the family. Primary Caregivers received $75 for their
interviews; each child in the household received $20 for participation. Elementary school teachers
for whom the primary caregiver gave permission to contact were interviewed by telephone and
received $20 for their participation.


CDS employed a number of flexible contact approaches to making the survey request. Emphasis
was placed on strategizing how/when the interviewers attempted contact with the respondent over
setting a pre-defined number of maximum contacts. Interviewers tailored their survey
introductions to the respondent’s concerns and individual situations, rather than using a predefined script. During field interviewer training, interviewers were given guidelines and hands-on
practice. This information and experience helped the interviewers address issues that arose on a
family-to-family basis, and helped make certain that the family felt comfortable with the wide
array of questions and instruments administered to both the caregivers and children. Interviewers
were given specialized training and a handbook to facilitate response to reluctance to participate
and also were given the option of working with the research staff on tailored persuasion letters for
resistant situations. The refusal conversion rate for CDS-II was 44%, resulting in less than 7% of
the families in a final refusal.


The biggest source of support in reaching response rate goals, however, was the close relationship
to the main PSID study. During the five-year gap in-between CDS-I and CDS-II, PSID
interviewed the families of the CDS children (in 1999 and 2001) and also kept in touch with them
through respondent postcard and report mailings. The PSID achieved a 96% response rate in the
prior wave (2001), retaining a high proportion of the sample, which in turn, helped to maintain
the CDS sample. CDS was able to capitalize on the contact information and efforts of that wave
of the main study.


During CDS-II field period, however, some tracking was required. A specialized expert field
tracking team carried out the more involved or complex tracking efforts for the hard-to-locate
families. Just over 10% of the sample required tracking at either the interviewer or tracking-team
level. At the end of the data collection, only 1% of the overall sample was unable to be located.


Team-based interviewing was used for 7% of the completed households for situations such as:
traveling interviewers into areas, interviewing in dangerous neighborhoods, and special family
situations whereby the interviewer thought a team-approach would help with gaining cooperation
as it reduced the amount of time spent in the respondent’s home.

## Chapter 6 – Primary Caregiver Interviews: Topical Guide

As described earlier, the PCG-Child interview focused on the primary caregiver’s report of the
sample child’s health, schooling, family relationships, and extra-curricular activities, while the
Household interview focused on the Primary Caregiver characteristics and behaviors and the
household environment. This chapter provides more detailed information about the key measures
in the Primary Caregiver interviews. Appendix A summarizes these measures and provides the
question number references for both CDS-I and CDS-II. Cross-wave references for individual
items are available in the Cross-Year Index selection within the Data Center. Questionnaires can
also be obtained on the web at: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/quescodetable.html.

**Health**


In the first section of the CDS-II PCG-Child interview, we ask the PCG a series of questions
assessing the sample child’s health status, use of health care services, and costs associated with
health care. The section starts out with a query about breastfeeding practices and age stopped
breastfeeding the child. These items are the same as asked in CDS-I. Then the interview launches
into a series of questions about health care utilization items, also included in CDS-I and modeled
from the NLSY79. Items A3-A3b, A5A8b, and A10 query the PCG about: frequency of overnight
hospital stays, date of most recent stay, reason for this hospital stay, month and year of last doctor
visits for illness, injury, and mental health and reason for each visit, and status of shots and
immunizations. New to CDS in the second wave, we coded responses to the open-ended
questions related to reasons for doctor visits. These data are available in the Data Center.


There are several groupings of questions within the health section that assess health status. These
measures included a global/general health rating, indication of limitations in activities that result
from health condition, and diagnosis of chronic conditions. More specifically, at A11, the PCG
rated the sample child’s health on a scale of ‘1’, meaning “Excellent” to ‘5’, meaning “Poor”.
New to CDS-II was a parallel youth-reported item. Children who were 10 years and older
reported their own health using this same item in the Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview. At
A9, we gathered information from the PCG about activity limitations of the sample child,
measured as three “YES/NO” items that queried the PCG if the child had any physical/mental
conditions that limited him/her in play, school attendance, or school work. These items are also
included in the child self-report interview for children 10 years and older. At A4a-p, the PCG
reported whether a doctor ever diagnosed the child with any of 16 chronic illnesses. CDS-II used
the same list as CDS-I, except “developmental delay” and “learning disability” were combined
into one item, and allergies were added. Individual items for CDS-II were:


� An epileptic fit or convulsion


� Asthma


� Diabetes


� More than 3 ear infections in a year


� Speech impairment or delay


� Serious hearing difficulty or deafness


� Serious difficulty seeing or blindness


� Mental retardation


CDS-II User Guide Page 25


� A serious emotional disturbance


� Anemia or iron deficiency


� Elevated levels of lead in the blood


� Orthopedic impairment


� Developmental problems, such as developmental delay or learning disability


� Autism


� Hyperactivity, ADHD, or ADD


� Allergies


� Other condition

CDS-II added a series of questions (A12-A16) that focused on the PCG’s report of the sample
child’s experience with asthma-related symptoms in the 12 months prior to the interview:


� Wheezing with exercise or playing hard


� Frequency of wheezing


� Hospital visits for asthma or wheezing


� Doctor visits for asthma or wheezing


� Missed school because of asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months

Finally, some information about health care costs to augment similar data collected in the main
PSID family interview was collected. At A17-A24, the PCG reported on the amount paid for
dental and medical insurance and for out-of-pocket dental and medical expenditures in the prior
12 months to the interview and who paid these expenses. This series was expanded from CDS-I.

**Education**


Information about the child’s schooling and school environment was collected in a number of
places in the CDS-II, including the teacher interview for the sample children in elementary
school, the linkages to the U.S. Department of Education’s Common Core of Data, and in the
PCG Child Interview. In Section B of the PCG interview, the PCG reported on her expectations
for the sample child’s educational attainment (B1-B3), enrollment in school and special/gifted
programs (B4-B6), the number of days in the past 12 months that the sample child missed school
because of illness and injury (B7), enrollment in federal breakfast/ lunch program (B8-B9),
number of times the CDS sample child changed school in current school year (B10), private and
public school attendance, school characteristics, fees, and tuition (B11-B22); age at which the
sample child began kindergarten, and if the sample child was ever suspended or ever drop out of
school (B28).


PCGs (and OCGs) are asked about their participation in the child’s education– specifically, their
interactions with teachers, counselors, administrators and volunteerism at the school; the
frequency and nature of communication between parent and child about school. These questions
were modeled after questions in the NELS: 88 parent baseline survey.


Page 26


**Behavior Problems Index**


Both waves of the CDS included the Behavior Problems Index (BPI) to assess the incidence and
severity of behavioral problems among children. [11] The Peterson and Zill (1986) measure was
developed from the more extensive Achenbach Behavior Problems Checklist. [12] Beginning at
question B29a in the PCG-Child Interview, the PCG reported whether each behavior was “often”,
“sometimes”, or “never” true of the sample child. Note that in CDS-I, the Secondary Caregiver,
Absent Father, and Teacher were asked the same questions about the sample children. Behaviors
were divided into two subscales, a measure of externalizing or aggressive behavior and a measure
of internalizing, withdrawn or sad behavior. B29aa-dd were added by the NLSY79 staff and
included in the CDS to provide additional measurement for the withdrawn behavior scale. Table
6.1 shows how the items map onto the external and internal subscales in the CDS-II data.


We performed a confirmatory factor analysis on our two expected subscales. The results showed
that the items grouped into these two factors quite well, with one variable overlapping on both
subscales, as did in CDS-I, and two variables not loading at all. We constructed an overall or total
BPI score, using all 30 items that loaded, as well as separate scores for each of the two subscales,
internal or withdrawn and external or aggressive behaviors. Before scoring, the individual items
were recoded such that a score of “2” became “0” and a score of “2” or “3” became a “2”. Scores
for the total BPI and Externalizing and Internalizing are sum scores. Higher scores on these
measures imply a greater level of behavior problems. Cases were included if they had valid data
on all of the variables contributing to the BPI Index: 2872 cases met this criterion for the BPI
total scale; 2,893 met this criterion for the BPI externalizing subscale and 2880 met this criterion
for the internalizing subscale. Please note that in CDS-I, the items were simply averaged for a
BPI score.

**The Positive Behaviors Scale**


In addition to measures of problematic child behaviors, as described above, both waves of the
CDS included measures of more favorable development, including the Positive Behaviors Scale.
The Positive Behavior Scale (B30), originally developed for the New Chance Evaluation (Polit,
1998 [13] ), measures the positive aspects of children’s lives, including self-esteem, social
competence, self-control, obedience/compliance, and persistence. The original scale consisted of
25 items evaluated on a 10-point scale, from “Not At All Like My Child” to “Very Much Like
My Child”. The scale used in the CDS consisted of 10 items that were selected by Child Trends,
Inc., for use in the JOBS evaluation study. The question reads: “Please tell me how much each
statement applies to (CHILD) on a scale from 1-5, where one means “not at all like your child,”
and five means “totally like your child,” and two, three and four are somewhere in between.”

Page 28


We performed a confirmatory factor analysis on the set of 10 items to verify that the items
mapped together. Factor loadings are provided in Table 6.2 below; reliability coefficient was .82.
The scale is a mean score of all 10 items. Cases were included if they had valid data on
approximately 75% of the variables contributing to the Positive Behavior Scale. Two cases did
not meet this inclusion criterion and were dropped from the analysis, leaving a total of 2,905
cases. The (unweighted) mean score on the Positive Behavior Scale (Variable “POSBEH02” in
the Data Center) was 4.13, with a range of 1 to 5, and a standard deviation of .60.  Cronbach’s
alpha = .82.

**Household Tasks**


The questions concerning household tasks that the primary caregiver did with the sample child
(B31) were intended to be one measure of cognitive stimulation in the family environment. These
items were modeled after similar items in the National Survey of Families and Households and
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. CDS-II used the same set of items as CDS-I, but
added “do yard work or gardening (together)”. The item “look at books with (CHILD)” was
modified in CDS-II to additionally include “…or talk with (CHILD) about books (he/she) has
read”.

**Parental Monitoring**


Stattin & Kerr (2000) [14] define parental monitoring as “a set of correlated parenting behaviors
involving attention to and tracking of the child’s whereabouts, activities, and adaptations”. This
definition emphasized both parents’ knowledge/awareness of their children’s activities as well as
their active monitoring of them. Based on these two components, CDS-II included a number of
items on parental knowledge and active monitoring at B33, B34, and B35a-B35r1 in the PCGChild and, from the child’s perspective, L23-L28 in Child interviews.

From the caregiver’s perspective, measures of the caregivers’ knowledge of the child’s
whereabouts, activities, and associations can be found at B33-B34:

|PCG-Child Interview|B33.|How many of (CHILD)’s close friends do you know by sight<br>and by first and last name?|
|---|---|---|
|PCG-Child Interview|B33a.|How many of (CHILD)’s close friends’ parents do you know<br>by sight and by first and last name?|
|PCG-Child Interview|B33c.|About how often did (CHILD) do things with (his/her) friends<br>outside of school in the last month?|
|PCG-Child Interview|B34.|About how often do you know who (CHILD) is with when<br>(he/she) is not at home?|



From the child’s perspective, measures of the caregiver’s knowledge of the child’s activities can
be found in the Child Interview, at L23-L25:

|Child Interview|L23.|Do your parents know what you do during your free time?|
|---|---|---|
|Child<br>Interview|L24.|Do your parents know which friends you hang out with during<br>your free time?|
|Child<br>Interview|L25.|Do your parents know what you spend your money on?|



One source of information about children’s activities is the children themselves. They may
choose to disclose their activities or whereabouts without being first asked. Child Disclosure
items can be found in the child interview, at L26-L28.

|Child Interview|L26.|Do you keep a lot of secrets from your parents about what you<br>do during your free time?|

Parents or caregivers may set rules about where, how, and with whom the child spends time, and,
in practice, they may enforce those rules to varying degrees, if at all. The PCGs reported on
household rules and enforcement practices of those rules at B35 in the PCG Child Interview. We
asked if the caregiver had rules about television watching, bedtime, snacking, homework, friends,
dating, curfews, and work hours. We then asked if the caregiver discussed and enforced each of
these rules with their children.

**Child Care**


The PSID main interview (see Section F, 2001 interview) contained some questions about the
family’s use of child care and its associated costs. In Section C of the CDS-II primary caregiver
interview, we asked the primary caregiver about all child care arrangements used during
weekday, weekend, and summer. We asked the type, frequency of use, and costs of arrangements
for children up to and after Kindergarten. When CDS-I and CDS-II data are put together, there
should be a fairly complete picture of formal and informal child care arrangements used from
birth up to the age of the child at the time of the CDS-II interview. Information on arrangements
used during weekday, weekend, and summer were obtained separately. Types of arrangements
queried were expanded in CDS-II to capture full range of options used through adolescence: care
by relatives under and over 13 years of age; care by non-relatives in or out of the home; Head
Start Program, Pre-kindergarten program, nursery school, preschool, or child care center; before
or after-school program, extra-curricular activities, and part-time jobs

**Absent Parents**


Questions on absent parent interactions obtained information about the frequency and types of
activities in which absent parents are involved with their children (D15a-d; D31a-d in PCG-Child
Interview) and any conflict between the resident parent and absent parent (D14a-h; D30a-h).
These items were drawn from the National Survey of Families and Households, supplemented by
additional items from other scales. It measures the degree of conflict between the parent with
whom the child resides and the absent parent. CDS-II included the same items as CDS-I except
two items were dropped: “how the absent parent spends money” and “disciplining (CHILD)”.

**Sample Child’s Extra Curricular Activities**


In the primary caregiver interview, we ask about the sample child’s involvement in a number of
school-based and community-based activities. The questions are located in sections F (children 35 years of age), G (children 6-9 years), and H (youth 10 years and older). We ask about
participation in lessons in dance, arts, hobbies, or academics; school and summer sports,
community groups such as scouts, library story hour, YMCA, or neighborhood groups, and
religious worship and social activities. For each activity, the PCG provides information about
costs associated with each activity.


Additional parallel measures are found in the time diary and child interview modules. The time
diaries have a detailed set of codes for sports, after-school, and community group participation on
the randomly selected weekday and weekend day. The child reports for him/herself in the Child
Interview – Section K.

**Child-Specific Expenditures and Savings**


In CDS-II, we expanded the measures on expenditures and savings for each sample child over the
content included in the CDS-I. In Section H, beginning at H23, the primary caregiver reported on
amount of money spent by household and non-household members, including absent parents on:
gifts, vacations, school supplies, clothing, car insurance, car payments, car maintenance, and
food. The primary caregiver also reported on amount of money in savings and assets that are in
the child’s name.


CDS-II User Guide Page 31


**HOME-SF**


The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form measured cognitive
stimulation and emotional support that parents provide to their children. This short form scale is
based on the original Caldwell and Bradley HOME Inventory (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984 [15] ) but
modified for the NLSY79. The particular items used in the CDS closely reflect (but do not
exactly replicate) the measures in the NLSY79. The HOME-SF items included both
parent/caregiver-reported items and interviewer observations of the home and neighborhood
environment. The measures can be used as independent variables to help explain developmental
outcomes for children and youth, or can be used as an outcome measures themselves, to better
understand relationships among the quality of environment and earlier familial and maternal
characteristics.


In CDS-II, we included the same age-appropriate items used in CDS-I (CDS-I also included
infant module), and supplemented this set with additional interviewer observations and items
from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). In CDS-II, items
from the Early Adolescent Scale were administered for sample children 10 years and older. The
appendix to this guide shows the mapping of CDS items onto the NLSY79 and PHDCN.


All HOME-SF items are located in the primary caregiver-child and primary caregiver-household
interviews, as well as in interviewer observations of caregiver-child interactions and the
neighborhood environment. HOME-SF questions, which vary by child age, were asked among
children of three age groups:


� Early Childhood (EC) - 3 to 5 year olds


� Middle Childhood (MC) -6 to 9 year olds


� Early Adolescent (EA) - 10 year olds and older

For each age group we constructed the total score and a subscore for cognitive stimulation. In
order to construct scores, we first recoded the individual items into dichotomous variables, with
values of zero and one. The recoding was guided by specifics from the NLSY79 [16] and detailed in
the appendix. Items with scores of zero and one were then summed, by age group. All HOME-SF
variables have one assigned decimal place.


Missing data on raw items were imputed prior to recoding of zero or one. In the imputation
procedures, all missing data were replaced by mean, median, or mode, depending on the variable
type and its distribution. Most of the variables had low levels of missing data; however, on a few
input variables, the number of missing data was so significant that we decided to exclude them
when constructing the HOME-SF scores. This procedure affected the following variables: Q21E4
and Q21E4A (27% of the cases missing, mainly due to children residing without a father) and all
input variables from the interviewer observations of mother-child interactions (18% of the cases
missing) and neighborhood environment (14% of the cases missing). Missing data on the
interviewer observations are largely attributed to a high geographic distribution of families in the
PSID-CDS sample, making some families out of range of our interviewers. If a family was not
close enough to at least two other eligible families to justify the high cost of traveling, we did not
make an in-person visit to the home, and relied on telephone and mail methods to obtain the other
parts of the interview.

We provide proration flag variables on the PCG-Child file that represent the number of
imputations conducted for each scale (HT1IMP02, CGIMP02, HT2IMP02, CG2MP02,
HT3IMP02, and CG3MP02). A flag variable with a score of zero indicates that all input items
were non-missing. Note, however, that sometimes the number of imputations is higher than the
number of dichotomous variables used to construct the scale. This is caused by the fact that some
dichotomous variables were created from more than one input item. Note that NLSY79 provides
scores for the Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales only for cases where no
more than one item is missing. In CDS-II, we constructed the subscales regardless of the number
of items requiring imputation – the flag variables allow you to set your own inclusion criteria
based on the number imputations.


In order to properly construct the HOME-SF scales, some of the input items regarding caregiver
reaction to child’s swearing/hitting – discipline items-that had originally been coded as “other”
were reviewed, and all verbatim comments recoded. The discipline item was generally scored as
0 if it was classified as a “harsh” response, such as a physical/severe response or
extensive/excessive deprivation. Non-harsh discipline items were coded as 1. There were four
cases in age group 10+ that were originally coded as “Other” in Release 2. Those cases led to the
creation of three new variables in Release 3 (Q21H17P – “Eat soap”, Q21H17Q – “Counseling”,
Q21H17R – “Make him my shadow/make him pay”) among which one – “eat soap” -was
classified as a “harsh” response. There were no responses classified as “other” in the youngest
age group, while in the middle age group (6-9 year olds) only one response was coded as “other,”
though it was a non-harsh response. In CD-II, the following responses were categorized as harsh
and scored as 0: “hit”, “spank”, “kick out of the house”, and “eat soap”.


While the CDS-II scores were constructed based on NLSY79 guidance, there were two questions
that are part of NLSY79 scales that were not administrated in CDS-II: The question of how often
the caregiver reads to the child was not asked in the 6-9 year old age group in CDS-II and the
interviewer observation about the safety in the child’s neighborhood (SLY CSOB-10C) was also
not administrated in CD-II. As mentioned above, some variables were excluded in the CDS-II due
to high rates of missing data.

**Neighborhood Measures**


The Primary Caregiver-Household module gathered some information about the sample child’s
neighborhood. At the beginning of Section J, the primary caregivers reported on length of
residence in the neighborhood, neighborhood quality, cohesiveness, and safety.


After the visit to the home, the interviewer recorded characteristics of the physical environment
of the home and neighborhood (K27-K39). These observations focused on the cleanliness and
appearance of the home and street, amount of living space, noise, signs of drug and alcohol use,
and safety. Interviewers were extensively trained in method for these observations.


**Rosenberg Self-Esteem for Primary Caregivers**


The Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale describes the degree of approval or disapproval toward oneself.
The scale is widely used, with substantial documentation on its validity and reliability. Primary
Caregivers reported on a series of 10 items at J9a-j, using response scale of 1-4, where 1 indicates
“Strongly Disagree” and 4 indicates “Strongly Agree”. Prior to scoring, items J9c, J9e, J9h, J9i,
J9j were reverse scored. A higher score designates higher self-esteem. Cases were included if
they had valid response on approximately 75% of the items. There were 2,889 cases with a self

CDS-II User Guide Page 33


esteem score.

The results of a confirmatory factor analysis showed that the items readily grouped together.
Factor loadings are provided in Table 6.3. The scale is a mean score of all 10 items. The mean
score on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Variable “SLFEST02” in the Data Center) was 3.43,
with a range of 1 to 4, and a standard deviation of .44. Cronbach’s alpha = .86.

**Pearlin Self-Efficacy Scale for Primary Caregivers**




|Number of Items|10|
|---|---|
|Mean Score|3.43|
|Cronbach’s Alpha|.85|
|Unweighted N|2889|



The Pearlin Self-Efficacy Scale assesses the extent to which people see themselves as having
control over aspects of their lives. This measure consisted of four of the original seven Pearlin
items (PCG-HH J10a-d) which were answered on a 4-point response scale (“Strongly Agree”,
“Agree”, “Disagree”, “Strongly Disagree”). The original scale has been shown to exhibit
reasonable internal reliability and good construct validity (see Pearlin et al, 1981 [17] ). The four
items used for CDS-II were selected based on factor analysis of CDS-I data where all seven items
were used. Items are averaged to produce an overall score.


Factor loadings from the confirmatory factor analysis are provided in Table 6.4. The scale is a
mean score of all four items. The mean score on the Pearlin Self-Efficacy Scale (Variable
“PEARLN02” in the Data Center) was 3.11, with a range of 1 to 4. Cronbach’s alpha = .79.

**Measure of Non-Specific Psychological Distress for Primary Caregivers**


The K-6 Non-Specific Psychological Distress Scale was developed by Ronald Kessler, Professor
of Healthcare Policy at Harvard Medical School, with support from the U.S. National Center for
Health Statistics. As described in more detail in Kessler et al. (2003 [18] ), the K-6 Non-Specific
Psychological Distress Scale was designed to discriminate cases of serious mental illness from
non-cases in a general population survey. The K-6 is now included in the core of the NHIS as
well as in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.

The K-6 includes six items that queried the primary caregivers about how they have been feeling
during the prior four weeks. Response items are based on a scale of 1-5, where 1 indicates “All of
the Time” and 5 indicates “None of the Time”. The items are rescored, following the coding in
the table on the next page, and summed. A score of 13 or higher indicates a potential for
nonspecific distress. In the CDS-II data, K6_02 had a mean of 4.12, standard deviation of 3.71,
range of 0-24, and total number of cases scored equal to 2,889.

Table 6.5. Recoding of the K-6 Scale









|In the last 4 weeks, about how often did you<br>feel …|All of the<br>Time|Most of<br>the Time|Some of<br>the Time|A Little of<br>the Time|None of<br>the Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|a. so sad that nothing could cheer you up?|4|3|2|1|0|
|b. nervous?|4|3|2|1|0|
|c. restless or fidgety?|4|3|2|1|0|
|d. hopeless?|4|3|2|1|0|
|e. everything was an effort?|4|3|2|1|0|
|f. worthless?|4|3|2|1|0|


The K-6 included not only the six Likert scale questions in the scales, but additional questions
about persistence and impairment that result from the symptoms. These additional questions are
not required to score the K-6.

**Parenting Attitudes, Styles, and Beliefs**


The PCG-Child and PCG-Household interviews have a number of measures on parenting
attitudes and experiences. Briefly, these variables are:


Parenting attitudes: types of compromises or life style adjustments to make life better for their
children.


Gender roles: PCG perceived responsibilities of mother and father roles.


Aggravation in Parenting Scale (E8a-c) and (J15a-d) measures parenting stress that may result
from changes in employment, income, and other factors in their lives.

Response to Poor Grades (G16a-j; H15a-j): These items query PCG on actions taken in response
to poor grades. CDS-II used the same items as CDS-I.

Encouragement of Reading (G18-G20): These items assess PCG encouragement of reading and
availability of dictionary and encyclopedia in the home.

Family conflict: methods of conflict resolution among family members.

Economic strain: experiences of economic or financial stress and strain and practical responses to
such pressures.

Work schedule: PCG work status; work schedule, and travel time one-way to the job site for the
respondent’s job or main job .

## Chapter 7 – Child Interview: Topical Guide

Children who were at least eight years of age and older were eligible to participate in an in-home
interview themselves. Almost all of the Child Interview was new to CDS-II, as more children
where old enough to report on their feelings and behaviors themselves. The interview content was
sub-divided into sections for children of different ages – the measurement resource table in
Appendix A gives details on various measures throughout the child interview.

**Interview Content for All Participating Children 8 Years and Older**


For all children participating in an interview, we asked about their own self-concepts in math and
reading, expectations for the future, connectedness to school, use of electronic media, and peer
bullying. We assessed the frequency in which the child conversed with mother, father and friends
about school, future plans, and friendships. Questions H5-6, in turn, queried the child about
his/her closeness with family members and other adults. We asked the children to describe the
frequency in which they experienced a range of health symptoms such as: feeling really sick,
waking up tired, having skin problems, feeling dizzy, experiencing chest pains, headaches,
muscle soreness, and stomachaches.


We generated three summary variables for the interview content that targeted all participating
children: ability self concepts for reading and math, and peer bullying. Methodology for
constructing these measures is described below.

_**Ability Self-Concepts**_

The Ability Self-Concepts items at E1-E20 reflect two scales developed and validated by
Jacquelynne Eccles for the domains of math and reading [19] . The same items were used both in
CDS-I and CDS-II, and are asked of children 8 years and older. We created summary variables
for reading and math by first reverse scoring E6 and E16 so that the scores ranged from low to
high, as other items. A confirmatory FA forced the analysis to two factors and generated a clear
delineation: all of the reading items loaded on the Reading Self-Concept factor (Factor 1 on the
table below, which accounted for 20% of the variance), while all of the math items loaded on the
Math Self-Concept factor (Factor 2, which accounted for 19% of the variance). We then
constructed an average score for each scale, and included a case if it had valid data on about 75%
of the variables. Three cases did not meet the scaling criteria for both Reading and Math scales
and were dropped, leaving a total of 2179 included cases. The scores ranged from 1.6 to 7 on the
Reading Self-Concept Scale, with a mean of 5.29 and a standard deviation of 1.0. On Math SelfConcept Scale, the scores ranged from 1.30 to 7, with a mean of 4.92 and standard deviation of
1.01.

_**Peer Bullying**_
We assessed frequency of peer victimization with four items at the beginning of Section H [20] (H1ad). These four items were rolled into a mean score for all cases having valid data on at least 75%
of the items.


A confirmatory factor analysis produced one factor that accounted for 31.24% of the variance and
had strong correlations to each item. We then constructed an average score, and included a case if
it had valid data on 75% of the variables. Seven cases did not meet the scaling criteria and were
dropped, leaving a total of 2175 included cases. The scores ranged from 1.0 to 5.75, with a mean
of 1.45 and standard deviation of .71. The alpha coefficient was .62. Factor loadings are shown
on the next page.

**Interview Content for Participating Youth 10 Years and Older**


Children in the adolescent-stage additionally participated in an Audio-Computer Assisted SelfInterview (ACASI) component whereby the children listened to the questions themselves on a
headset and then responded directly into the laptop. Children 10 years and older could participate
in Section K that included: a parallel set of questions to the PCG that queried the child about time
spent in after school and community activities, involvement of friends, hobbies, sports
participation, and pro-social behaviors. We gathered some additional information about how the
youth themselves rate and evaluate their health. We included the self-reported health question, a
single item that asked the child to rate his/her own health on a scale of 1 (Excellent) -5 (Poor).
This item has a parallel measure in the Primary Caregiver interview, where we asked the
caregiver to describe the child’s general health status. We asked the youth about their practices
for maintaining their weight, their dietary habits, exercise at and outside of school, any limitations
in activities that they experience because of their health (parallel item to the ones in the Primary
Caregiver Interview), and sleeping patterns.

_**Global Self Concept Scale**_

We created a summary variable for the Global Self Concept Scale by taking the mean of items
K27-K32 if the case had valid data on a minimum of five out of the six items. Confirmatory
factor analysis was conducted; factor loadings are shown in Table 7.3 below. The scale included
1735 cases – 13 did not meet inclusion criterion and were dropped. The scale scores ranged from
1.0 to 5.0, with an overall scale mean was 3.30 and standard deviation of 1.78. The scale alpha
was .82.

**Interview Content for Participating Youth 12 Years and Older**


For youth 12 years and older, we included additional questions administered by the interviewer as
well as through the ACASI module. The interviewer-administered section (Section J) included
questions about the youth’s self-identified ethnicity, religious affiliation, importance of religion
and time spent in worship and religious groups, and importance of spirituality. We asked a series
of questions about current and summer employment, including type of job, which was then coded
with census occupation and industry codes, characteristics of the job, including level of
responsibility, autonomy, opportunity to learn new skills; satisfaction with the job, plans to
continue with current / summer job, wage rate, and work hours. We additionally asked a series of
questions about job values and expectations for future careers. Next, we asked a series of
questions about expectations for the future – mainly, marriage, divorce, parenting, schooling, and
economic security. These questions are carried forward into the Transition into Adulthood
interview.

The final set of questions in Section J focuses courses that the youth took in junior high / middle
school and high school. We asked for a complete list of courses for two terms prior to the
interview, exact titles of the courses, and grades.

The ACASI module for youth 12 years and older started with a series of items about savings and
expenditure patterns. Youth are asked about allowances, savings accounts and goals for savings,
particularly future schooling, and spending on a variety of items such as contributions to the main
family for household expenses, car expenses, and entertainment.

The next long series of questions is at L11, and focuses on delinquent behaviors. Adolescents
indicated the frequency of engagement in 10 different behaviors in the past six months that range
in severity from staying out past curfew to harming others badly enough to require medical
attention.

At L12-L15, we collected information about experiences with tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. For
tobacco, alcohol, and drugs each, adolescents reported if they ever tried, age at which they first
tried, frequency of use, and peer use. These questions were adapted from the ADD Health study.

The set of items L17a-b, L17d, L17g, L17i, L17j; L18a-b, L18d, L18g, L18i, L18j were adapted
from work by B. Barber (1996) intends to measure psychological control, as reported by the
child [21] . Six out of the original eight items were retained for CDS-II.

_**Children’s Depression Inventory Short Form (CDI:S)**_
The Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) [22] was developed by Maria Kovacs. The measure is
designed as a diagnostic instrument that quantifies depressive symptomatology of children 7 to 17
years of age. It is an established measure, copyrighted by the Multi-Health Systems Incorporated
and has been validated with normative populations of children 7-17 years of age. At L16, we
included the short form of the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI), where youth reported on
symptoms of depression during the two weeks prior to the interview.

_**Social Initiative**_

The items at L22a-e were adapted from Bachman et al (1993) and B. Barber (1996) and are
designed to measure social initiative. Five out of the original 13 items were retained for CDS-II
based on Barber’s recommendations. This scale was given to only the children in the sample who
were at least 12 years of age. We constructed a mean score for the Social Initiative Scale and
included the case if it had valid data on a minimum of four out of the five items. There were a

total of 1267 cases included in this analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis had an overall of 3.61,
with a standard deviation of 1.27 and range of scores from 1 to 6. The alpha coefficient for the
scale was .81. Factor loadings are shown in Table 7.4 below.

_**Subjective Well-Being**_
Questions L37a-c; L37d-h; L37k-n were adapted from MacArthur MIDUS Youth [23] and were
designed to measure several dimensions of Subjective Well-Being among adolescents in CDS-II:
Emotional Well-Being (L37a-c); Social Well Being (L37d-h); and Psychological Well Being
(L37k-n). These questions were self-administered for youth 12 years and older. We constructed
the emotional, social, and psychological well-being measures from the L37 items as mean scores
if the respondent provided response on 75% of the items within each subscale. The continuous
measure of flourishing is the sum of three subjective well-being measures. Descriptive statistics
are provided in Table 7.5 below.

## Chapter 8 Assessments

The CDS-II assessment module included measures of the child’s height and weight, using tape
measures and scales, and measures of the child’s cognitive abilities, using the Woodcock-Johnson
Revised Test of Achievement and WISC-III Digit Span. This chapter gives an overview of the
procedures used for collecting these data.

**Height and Weight Measures**


In CDS-I, we gathered reported weight of the child from the Primary Caregiver and interviewermeasured height of the child, using a rafter square and tape measure (see Section A of the CDS-I
Primary Caregiver-Child interview). In CDS-II, we attempted to measure and weigh all of the
children and youth for whom we were able to get an in-person interview. In the assessment
questionnaire for CDS-II you will find question items for (a) in-person measurement / weighing
by the interviewer; or (b) self-report height and weight. Body Mass Index (BMI) and percentile
rank were calculated for all children with height and weight data.


_**Administration Procedures**_

The procedure for measuring height and weight was as follows: If the child was under 6 years,
interviewers asked the PCG or a family member for assistance in taking off the child’s shoes,
helping the child onto the scale, and encouraging the child to stand still. Directions were given
directly to both the child and family member assisting the interviewer. If the child was 6 years or
older, the interviewer instructed the child / youth directly and asked a family member for
assistance only if necessary. If the child or youth refused to be measured, the interviewer asked
them or the primary caregiver (depending on age) to report height and weight, or best estimate of,
and the date the child was last measured.


To measure the child or youth’s height, the interviewer asked them to take off their shoes and
stand against a wall or door. The interviewer placed a Post-it note on the wall right above the
child's height, and then positioned a rafter's square against the wall directly over the child's head.
A mark was placed on the Post-it note at the child's height. When the child moved away from the
wall, the interviewer positioned the tape measure under a door jam or her foot and measured from
the floor to the mark on the Post-it.


To weigh the child or youth, the interviewer asked them to empty their pockets and remove their
shoes, activated the scale and set it to zero. Once the scale showed “0.0”, the child stepped onto
the scale and stood in the center of the scale for 5-10 seconds. The same brand/model of scale

was used for all children:

_**BMI-for-Age**_

While Body Mass Index (BMI) for adults is based simply on height and weight, BMI for children
and teens, also referred to as “BMI-for-Age”, additionally takes into account age and gender. The
reason is that children's body fatness changes over time as they grow, and boys and girls differ in
their body fatness as they develop. BMI-for-age is plotted on gender specific growth charts for
children and teens 2 – 20 years of age. You can obtain more information on the CDC Growth
Charts at: http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/.

Each of the CDC BMI-for-age gender specific charts contains a series of curved lines indicating
specific percentiles. The percentile cutoff points identify underweight and overweight in children:

Underweight BMI-for-age < 5th percentile


At risk of overweight BMI-for-age 85th percentile to < 95th percentile


Overweight BMI-for-age > 95th percentile


In the CDS-II data, we have included BMI score and percentile score for each child/youth. BMI
was calculated using pounds and inches with this equation:


Weight in Pounds


BMI = () x 703


(Height in inches) x (Height in inches)


Percentile categories were calculated based on the CDC growth charts referenced above. When
the CDSII data are used with the sample weight, the distribution of girls and boys in the weight
percentile categories closely parallels the finding from the NHANES. See Table 1 for distribution
of CDS-II and NHANES data, for children and youth 6-18 years.

**Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement**

_**Description of the Test**_
Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R) is a well-established and
respected measure that provides researchers with information on several dimensions of
intellectual ability, including current developmental status, degree of mastery in reading and
mathematics, and group standing (either age or grade group). In the CDS-I and CDS-II, we
selected three subtests as a measure of reading and match achievement: the Letter-Word, the
Passage Comprehension, and the Applied Problems tests (the Calculation test was additionally
administered in CDS-I). These scales can be used individually, or in the case of the four
subscales, combined to create scores for Broad Reading and Broad Math. When applicable, the
Spanish version of the WJ-R (Batería-R, Form A), was used for children whose primary language
wasSpanish .

_**Administration**_

The Woodcock-Johnson Revised (WJ-R) Tests of Achievement have standardized administrative
protocols. For respondents under 6 years, the interviewer administered two subtests: Letter-Word
Identification and Applied Problems. For respondents 6 years and older, the interviewer
additionally administered the Passage Comprehension subtest. The paragraphs below provide
information on the main procedures for administering these tests; the user is encouraged to obtain
Woodcock-Johnson materials and training (see the Riverside Publishing website for details that
help to fully understand the complete requirements for the standardized administration).

The Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-R) Test of Achievement is an ‘easel’ test, or a test with a response
book that sits in front of the respondent. The interviewers placed the easel at an angle so that they
and the respondents could both see the stimuli (pictures) simultaneously. Each test required that
the interviewer administer it exactly as described in training and in their interviewer manual. Any
deviation from these procedures invalidated the results.

Since the WJ-R can be used for respondents from ages 2 to 90 years, items in the WJ-R were
arranged by difficulty for all persons between those ages. The easiest questions were presented
first and the items became increasingly difficult as the respondent proceeded through the test. The
interviewer started testing at the appropriate starting point based on education level of the child or
youth as the general guideline. At the beginning of every subtest, usually on the first page, there
was a chart organized by grade in school that informed the interviewer at what item they should
start administering the test. To administer the test, the interviewer turned to the page where the
starting item is located.


Page 44


Raw scores were calculated for the WJ-R using basal and ceiling. The basal and ceiling criteria
were created to limit the amount of time any one person spends on each subtest. When the
respondent got six or more consecutive items correct, then they established their basal. The
interviewer continued testing until the respondent established ceiling, which was six or more
consecutive items incorrect and the end of the testing page has been reached.

_**Scoring**_

The Woodcock-Johnson Revised (WJ-R) Tests of Achievement have standardized scoring
protocols. The tests are designed to provide a normative score that shows the CDS target child’s
reading and match abilities in comparison to national average for the child’s age. The normed
scores are constructed based on the target child’s raw score on the test (essentially the number of
correct items completed) and the child’s age to the nearest month. Raw scores are charted on
normative tables based on the child’s age and what percentile the child falls into.

The first step in creating standardized test scores for the Woodcock-Johnson Revised (WJ-R)
subtests was to enter all of the hardcopy scoring tables into electronic spreadsheet files so the
scoring could be done by computer. The second step was to calculate the subjects’ age at the time
of testing. This was accomplished by comparing their birth date with the testing date. The syntax
also incorporated commands to properly round days and months per WJ-R scoring rules. This
variable was properly formatted to match the values given in the WJ-R scoring tables.

The next step was to create a programming loop to choose the correct version of the testing form
used, either Form A, Form B, or Form Spanish. Then the raw score for each subtest could be
matched to an intermediate number known as the W Score – this intermediate step allows
standardization across the different forms of the WJ-R. The W Score is then compared against the
Reference W Score, which is the average W Score for a child that age.

The Reference W has to be compared to child's W Score to determine the difference and whether
that difference is positive or negative. One of the scoring tables provides the number of a lookup
column, and which column is used depends on the child’s age, the magnitude of the difference
score, and whether the difference score was positive or negative. Furthermore, the value of the
difference between the child’s W Score and the Reference W also determines which lookup row
will be used. Since negative difference scores would have been problematic in the look-up tables,
their absolute values were taken and then added to 400 to make them easily distinguishable from
positive scores. Likewise, a difference score of zero was converted to 900. The standardized score
is found at the intersection of the proper row and column, and this information was then
transferred back to the main data file.

**WISC Digit Span Test for Short Term Memory**


The WISC Digit Span Test for Short Term Memory [24 ] is a test of our ability to process
information as it directly measures auditory short-term working memory. Digit span is the
measure of how many sequential digits can be taken in, stored, processed, and recalled in the
correct order. In CDS-I and II, the interviewer read a series of digits and the respondents then
repeated the series. The series begin with two digits and keep increasing in length until eight
digits, with two trials at each length. The test was repeated with a different set of digit series, but
the second time, the respondent repeated the numbers backwards.

_**Administration Procedures**_

Interviewers were given the following instructions:


(1) Read each digit span only once at an even rate of one digit per second.
(2) Read Part A of a question; pause for response; then score.
(3) Read Part B of a question; pause for response; then score.
(4) If child does not respond after reading the question, do not encourage further.
(5) Stop when child misses Part A and Part B of any one question.
(6) To be scored as “correct”, no digits may be omitted or be in reversed order.
(7) READ TO CHILD: I can only read these instructions to you one time. I cannot repeat
them. I am going to say some numbers. Listen carefully, and when I am through, say them right
after me.

SAY: “Ready” BEFORE EACH QUESTION.

_**Scoring**_
Items were scored by summing the number of sequences answered correctly. The data files
include a digit-forward, digit-backward, and total score.

## Chapter 9 – Time Diaries

The time diaries are one of the unique features of the CDS design and provide data of central
importance to scientists in many disciplines. While the primary caregiver (PCG) and Child
interviews include stylized questions about the children’s structured and unstructured activities,
and activities with parents and absent parents, the time diaries provide detailed accounting of the
type, number, duration, and location of activities during sampled 24-hour days, beginning at
midnight for one randomly sampled weekday and one randomly sampled weekend day. The time
diaries additionally collect information on the social context of the activity by specifying with
whom the child was doing the activity and who else was present, but not engaging.

Response rate for the time diaries was 88% in 2002/2003 (82% in 1997). The PCG completed the
diary for the very young children; older child and adolescents were expected to complete the time
diaries themselves or with the assistance of the PCG as needed.

With child-based weights, the time diaries give a representative national sample of children’s
activities and can also be converted into traditional time use aggregates, which are known to
provide less biased estimates of time amounts than do self-reports of time in particular activities
(Juster, Ono and Stafford, 2003 [25] ). By nature of the CDS design, the rich time diary data can be
used with the detailed information in the other CDS modules as a way to examine influences on
key developmental outcomes and achievement patterns, and can also be used with PSID data to
parcel out the ways in which family characteristics tie into children’s activity choices and
developmental outcomes.

**Data Collection**


We invited CDS children and youth to complete a set of time diaries as part of their involvement
in the overall CDS data collection effort. Each participating child completed two time diaries, a
weekday (Monday-Friday) and weekend day (Saturday or Sunday). These days were randomly
selected when the interviewer completed the initial contact for the household. There was no
substitution of diary days once they were assigned to the CDS child/youth.

In both waves, the CDS time diary was a paper diary that was mailed ahead before the scheduled
interview, with instructions to complete prior to the interview. During the in-house CDS
interview or by telephone, the interviewer reviewed and edited the diary with the child and
primary caregiver or, in the situations whereby the diary was not completed in advance, the
interviewer administered the diary as an interview. On average, the review/ interview time was
just under 17 minutes per diary, per child. A summary of the data collection design is provided in
Table 9.1 on the next page.

**Coding**


We utilized the same interviewing procedures and coding protocols for the time use module in
both waves of the CDS. With the older age-range of the children in the CDS-II (ages ranged from
5 to 18 years), the activity codes were somewhat expanded to capture more detail for participation
in community, school, and active leisure activities. Codes were added to the “organizational
activities” group to include participation in specific types of helping organizations and detailed
extracurricular school clubs and organizations. CDS-II added details to the “sports and active
leisure” group to capture specific sport or recreational activity.

In order to accommodate these new detailed codes but also allow for easy mapping back to the
CDS-I data, CDS-II created a four-digit activity code whereby the first three digits reflect the
1997 code. If the code was expanded to capture more specific detail, a sequential number
beginning with “2” was added as the fourth digit. The fourth (last) digit is a “0” for any code that
remained identical to CDS-I code, or in the case of an expanded code category for CDS-II, a “0”
in the fourth digit indicates a catch-all / unspecified code for that particular activity. The activity
codebook is on the CDS website at URL:


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/Codebooks/2003codebook.pdf.


To help illustrate the point, here is an example. In CDS-I, we coded “homework” as one type of
activity. In CDS-II, we expanded the homework category to capture a distinction among noncomputer related homework, studying time, library time, and homework review with the parents
or caregivers. In the CDSII activity codebook the specific homework codes 5491-5494 are
indented under 5490, which visually identifies that they are new codes to 2002, with 5490 as a
general “catch all” code that was used in 1997. An excerpt from the codebook is on the next page:


Page 48


Table 9. 2 Example: Homework Codes in CDS-II Time Diaries

|Code|Code Description|
|---|---|
|5490. <br> <br>|General category for homework/studying-specific activity NA.<br>Note: in 1997 code “549” read: “Homework, non-computer related, Studying,<br>research, reading, related to classes or profession, except for current job (code<br>0790) and “Went to the library”. These activities are coded separately in 2002<br>(see below).|
|5491.<br> <br> <br>|Homework, non-computer related.<br>Note. Homework using computer, code as 5040.|
|5492. <br> <br> <br>|Studying, research, reading, related to classes or profession, except for current<br>job (code 0790), college applications, working on school project.|
|5493. <br>|“Went to the library”|
|5494. <br> <br> <br>|Reviewing homework with parent/caregiver.<br>Note. This is new item.|



In addition to these variables, the CDS Media Files were made public in 2008. These include
data for both CDS-I and CDS-II. The Center for Research on Interactive Technology, Television
and Children (CRITC) at the University of Texas at Austin coded the television programs that
were reported in the 1997 and 2002 CDS Time Diaries. There are eight variables generated by
the media coding project:

(1) Format (TD97M09, TD02M09);
(2) Intended Audience (TD97M10, TD02M10);
(3) Character Age (TD97M11, TD02M11);
(4) Genre (TD97M12, TD02M12);
(5) Comedy (TD97M13, TD02M13);
(6) Science Fiction, Fantasy or Supernatural/Paranormal (SF/F/SP) (TD97M14, TD02M14);
(7) Curriculum (TD97M15, TD02M15); and
(8) Violence (TD97M16, TD02M16) of each television program.

The television coding manual and the data files are now available. This document describes the
data structure and coding procedures. For more information on the Media Files please see
Appendix E.


**Data Files**


The CDS time diary data files are posted on the PSID-CDS Data Center
(http://simba.isr.umich.edu/), freely accessible to researchers worldwide who are interested in
using the data. The data are available at the activity level for both CDS-I (131,060 total activities,
for an average of 22 activities per diary) and CDS-II (99,467 total activities, for an average of 20
activities per diary) and at child level, with the activities grouped into broader or “aggregated”
variables. The illustration below shows you where you first need to go to access the time diary
data – either the activity level (select “Time Diaries”) or aggregate level (select “CDS incl. Time
Diary Aggregates”):


CDS-II User Guide Page 49


_**Time Diary Activity-Level Files**_

The Time Diary Activity data file is structured at the activity level, meaning one data record per
activity. There are three important identifiers in this file: (1) the ID68 (ER30001)-PN (ER30002)
combination to identify the child for whom the activity belongs, (2) the “Diary_02” to identify if
the activity belongs to a weekday or a weekend diary (we reviewed earlier that each child had up
to two diaries taken – one for a randomly selected weekday and one for a randomly selected
weekend. “T1_02” specifies the actual day of the week), and (3) the start time of the activity,
variable “COLB_02”. Start and end time are represented in seconds past midnight. The duration
of the activities are recorded as amount of time in seconds that the activity took place.

The other variables in the data file are few in number - each one representing a column in the
time diary grid.. See http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/questionnaires/cdsii/english/cdsiitdday.pdf for an example of the instrument. Since Columns G and H are “select all
that apply” questions in the diary, there is a variable for each possible option:

|Participating<br>(Column G in Time Grid)|There, but Not Participating<br>(Column H in Time Grid)|
|---|---|
|COLGA_02: NO ONE ELSE<br>COLGB_02: MOTHER<br>COLGC_02: FATHER<br>COLGD_02: SIBLING<br>COLGE_02: STEP-MOTHER<br>COLGF_02: STEP-FATHER<br>COLGG_02: STEP-SIBLING<br>COLGH_02: CHILD FRIEND<br>COLGI_02: GRANDPARENT|COLHA_02: NO ONE ELSE<br>COLHB_02: MOTHER<br>COLHC_02: FATHER<br>COLHD_02: SIBLING<br>COLHE_02: STEP-MOTHER<br>COLHF_02: STEP-FATHER<br>COLHG_02: STEPSIBLING<br>COLHH_02: CHILD'S FRIEND<br>COLHI_02: GRANDPARENT|

COLGK_02: OTHER NON- COLHK_02: OTHER NON

RELATIVE RELATIVE

You can print out just a codebook of the file through the Data Center. To do this, simply select
the variables through the Data Center, but at the very last step, select “codebook only”. Since the
activity codes for columns A and J are so extensive, they are provided in a separate document:
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/Codebooks/2003codebook.pdf.

To give a better understanding of how the time diary activity file is structured, take a look at the
example data file below. The first 32 rows are activities that span two diaries T1_02=7 (Sunday)
and T1_02=4 (Wednesday) for child “0004”-“039”. COLA_02 specifies the activity and
COLB_02 and COLC_02 specify the start and end time of the activity, respectively. There are 17
activity records for the Sunday diary and 15 activity records for the Wednesday diary. The first
data record, for example, shows that child “0004”-“039” was sleeping (activity code 4590) from
midnight (start time in seconds past midnight=0) to 9:00 AM (end time in seconds past midnight
=32400 seconds). The child was not watching television so the variable COLD_02, activity type,
is coded as INAP (0). The child was at home during this activity (COLF_02=10). Variable
COLGA_02 is coded as INAP (0) since we did not collect information about with whom the child
was engaged in the activity for activities under the personal care category. There are more
variables in the data file, but this illustration should get you on the way to understanding the file
structure of the Activity file.

CDS-II User Guide Page 51


_**Time Diary Aggregate Files**_

In addition to the activity-level files, there are child-level time diary files which “roll-up”
individual activities in several ways: at the four-and three-digit code levels, which take all of the
time spent in each of the activities and sum them across the diary day, and at the two-digit level,
which aggregate time per diary day by 39 activity categories. These aggregate files are posted at
the child-level, facilitating their use with developmental data from the other CDS modules,
including (but not limited to) achievement measures, physical and emotional health assessments,
and family environment measures, or with PSID family economic and demographic data.


In the aggregate file, there is one record per child and a variable that will tell you if that child has
weekday diary data and another variable that will tell you if the child has weekend diary data. The
labeling convention is, as follows:


Variables that begin with “WD” indicate that it is a “weekday” activity; variables that begin with


Page 52


“WE” indicate that it is a “weekend” activity. For CDS-II, the next two components of the
variable name is “02”, meaning, data collection start year 2002.


As mentioned above, there are four-digit aggregate variables, three-digit aggregate variables, and
two digit aggregate variables. You can ascertain the level of the aggregation by the naming
convention. For the variables that roll up the activities at the four-digit level, the next four
components of the variable name are the four digit code for the activity. For the variables that roll
up the activities at the three-digit level, the next four components of the variable name are an
underscore (“_”) and the three digit equivalent (or, CDS-I equivalent) for the activity. For the
variables that roll up the activities at the two-digit level, the next four components of the variable
name are “39”, representing 39 categories and the two-digit code for the activity.


For example, let’s take a look at our previous example about homework time.


The four-digit aggregate variables for homework on weekdays are: WD024590, WD024591,
WD024592, WD024593, and WD024594.


The three-digit aggregate is the sum of all of the specialized homework codes and for weekday, is
represented as “WD02_549”: WD02_549 is equal to SUM (of WD025490, WD025491,
WD025492, WD025493, WD025494).


The two-digit aggregate that includes homework time is “EDUCATIONAL AND
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING”, code WD023913.


As in the Time Diary Activity-Level file, the duration of the activities are given seconds.

## Chapter 10 – CDSII School Data

The CDS provides information about the schools in which the target children and youth attend in
several ways. As described earlier, in the primary caregiver interview, the primary caregivers
reported on the target child’s current school enrollment, type of school (public or private; homeschooled), tuition and other school-related costs; grade in school, age began kindergarten,
program enrollment for gifted youth or for special education, and if child ever repeated a grade or
ever dropped out of school. They additionally reported out on their involvement in their
children’s schools and own family processes that encourage academic interests and achievements.

In the Elementary School Teacher interview, the target child’s teachers provided some
information about the school environment for the elementary-school aged children, including
teacher-child relationships, social processes in classrooms, and target children’s classroom
behaviors.

In 1997, CDS-I included surveys of school administrators to gather more information about the
schools that the CDS children attend. In these surveys, we asked school administrators to provide
data about school enrollment, staffing, special programs, general climate, revenues and
expenditures. Unfortunately, only 32% of elementary school administrators responded to the
survey. Instead of gathering reports from school administrators in CDS-II, we drew upon school
characteristic data collected by the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD). This approach potentially provides more
comprehensive data on the school environment and the school district, helping to minimize
missing data points resulting from non-response on the administrator survey, and improve overall
quality of these data.

What is the “CCD”? The CCD is a national database of all public elementary and secondary
schools and school districts in the United States. Data are available on the U.S. Department of
Education’s website. The CCD survey annually collects data about all public elementary and
secondary schools, all local education agencies, and all state education agencies throughout the
United States. CCD contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on
schools and school districts; data on students and staff; and fiscal data. We have an “ID Map”
under sensitive data contract whereby users can extract additional CCD information for the CDS
sample. This map provides the CDS identifiers along with the NCES CCD school and school
district identifiers for the school that the CDS child or youth attended during the CDS-I and CDSII interview.

## Chapter 11 Coded Variables in the PCG and Child Interviews

Coding was performed by the Institute for Social Research’s Survey Research Operations (SRO)
group. Approximately 10 percent of the cases were coded twice, once by the coder and a second
time (check coding) by the SRO Production Manager assigned to the project. Check coding is an
item-by-item check where a coder’s work is evaluated and verified.

**Occupation & Industry for Youth’s Jobs**

The U. S. Census’ 2000 Occupation & Industry Code Lists (U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic
Surveys Division), consisting of approximately 980 occupation and 980 industry codes, were
used to classify responses to several job related open-ended questions in the Child interview:


Q23J6. Think about the job in which you work the most hours. What is your
occupation? What kind of work do you do on this job? What are your most
important activities or duties?


Q23J7. What kind of business or industry is that in? What do they make or do at this
workplace?


Q23J20. Think about the job in which you work the most hours. What was your
occupation? What kind of work did you do? What are your most important
activities or duties?


Q23J21. What kind of business or industry is that in? What do they make or do at this
workplace?


Q23J31. What are the three kinds of jobs you would like to have when you are done
with school?


Q23J32. Which job do you want most?


Q23J33. We can’t always get the jobs we want. Which job do you think you will
actually get to do?

**Code Frames for Open-Ended Questions**


When developing the framework for coding open-ended responses, the goal was to avoid
subjective judgments as much as possible and link coding to objective decision rules. To this end,
open-ended responses were first sorted into obvious groupings based on just the phrases or words
that the respondent used. All mentions, not just the most common ones, were included, and
counts assigned. This constituted the universe of items to be coded.

“Lowest common denominator” categories were then grouped (if possible) into larger
categories. Internet searches and background research often provided guidance in this step. If a
lowest common denominator category was substantially large, it was given its own category.
These “lowest common denominator” categories allowed obvious groupings to be spotted, while
at the same time implicating other potential groupings that could be developed after some
investigation. Every effort was made to maintain similar code frames for similar questions, such


CDS-II User Guide Page 55


as codes 30-97 for questions about family activities, hobbies, lessons, sports and community
programs in which the child may be involved.

**Child Interview**

At the beginning of Section J, for the CDS youth aged 12 years and older, we asked about
racial/ethnic identify and religious affiliation. Questions were formatted as open-ended items
whereby the youth reported on these identifications in their own words.

In the work items in the Child Interview, we ask if the youth plan to continue their current jobs
into the future – and the reasons why.

**PCG Child Interview**

In Section A, we asked the PCG about the target child’s reasons for visits to the hospital and to
the doctor – either for illness or for injury. The open-ended text was categorized by what the
respondent said – we did not attempt to roll the data into any type of classification scheme.

In Section B, we asked the PCG several open-ended questions about their child’s current
education and expectations for future education. We categorized the data based on the responses
themselves.

Q21B3. What things might keep this child from getting as much education
as (he/she) wants? (This item is also in the Other Caregiver
Interview)

Q21B16b. Please specify the reason why (CHILD) is currently in a special
education class or program.

Q21B20a. Why did you wait to enroll (CHILD) in kindergarten?

In Sections E, G, and H, we ask several open-ended questions about family activities, hobbies,
and extra curricular activities that were then categorized into groupings based on the data:

Q21E15a.  In what family activities is (CHILD) included?

Q21G2a. & Q21H2a. What are (CHILD)’s hobbies?

Q21G5b. & Q21H5b. (Was (CHILD) in a tutoring program in the last 12 months?) What
was the tutoring for?
Q21G6d. & Q21H9d. Which religious activities was (CHILD) involved in?


Q21G7a. & Q21H6a. Did (CHILD) take lessons, such as music, dance, or drama in the
last 12 months? Which lessons was (CHILD) involved in?


Q21G8a, Q21H7a, Q21G8g, & Q21H7e. Which school athletic or sports teams is/was
(CHILD) involved in during this/last school year?


Page 56


Q21G8d & Q21H7c Which organized sports programs was (CHILD) involved in during
last summer?

Q21G10a. & Q21H8a. Which community groups or programs was (CHILD) involved in?

## Chapter 12 – PSID Data Resources

As mentioned in the first chapter, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal
survey of a nationally representative sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning
almost four decades of data collection, contains over 48,000 variables on a diverse set of topics,
including the dynamics of family composition change, marital and birth histories, housing,
income, wealth, and welfare participation; health status of family members, expenditures,
philanthropy, and more. Over 60,000 people have ever participated in the panel, which includes
up to three generations within a family. The PSID is the longest running panel on family and
individual (including child) dynamics and has consistently achieved response rates of 96-98
percent. More information about the study and its instruments can be obtained from its website:
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/Overview.html. The PSID bibliography provides references
to studies using the data for many research topics (key word index provided):
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/.


As a CDS data user, the rich family data resource in the main PSID provides an incredible
opportunity to explore family environmental factors in your analyses of child outcomes. In this
chapter, our goal is to provide you with some basic (although not comprehensive) information
about the PSID sample, interview content, public and sensitive data contract file, and data
structure. Let’s start first with an overview of the sample origins and design.


**The PSID Sample**


The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from two independent samples: a nationally
representative sample of roughly 3,000 households designed by the Survey Research Center at the
University of Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and an over-sample of roughly 2,000 low income
families from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO sample”). From 1968 to 1996, the
PSID interviewed and re-interviewed individuals from families in these two samples every year,
whether or not they were living in the same dwelling or with the same people. Since 1997,
interviewing has taken place every other year. Also in 1997, the PSID added an immigrant
refresher sample that was intended to bring the sample up to representativeness of immigration
into the U.S. since 1968.


PSID follows adults through the full life course. Children born to an original-sample member are
classified as sample members and are eligible for tracking as separate family units when they set
up their own households. Ex-spouses and other adult sample members who move out of the PSID
family units are tracked to their new family units. This procedure replicates the population’s
family-building activity and produces a dynamic sample of families each year. New PSID
families form when children grow up and establish separate households or when marriage
partners go separate ways. The unique self-replacing design implies that for many PSID families,
the data include self-reported information on three (and occasionally now, four) generations
within the same family at various points in their life course. Through multiple waves collected
over long time periods on a national population, the PSID is the only data set ever collected on
life course and multigenerational economic conditions, well-being, and health in a long-term
panel representative of the full U.S. population.

**PSID Content**

As touched on above, the PSID contains a large number of variables that have been measured
wave after wave in much the same, if not the identical, manner. The table below gives a general
idea of the data collected but is by no means comprehensive. Years are provided when data were
collected for only some, but not all 34 waves of the PSID. Keep in mind that this table is by no
means exhaustive of the PSID content. Please see http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu documentation
for more details on the PSID measures.

**Family and Individual Level Variables in the PSID**

PSID variables can be categorized as family-level and individual-level. Most of the information
from any year’s data collection is categorized as **family-level variables** . The family-level
variables include not only information that applies to the family unit as a whole, but also almost
all information about the head and wife/ “wife”. **Individual-level variables** are wave specific
data as well as time invariant information that may span many years. These variables cover basic


Page 62


demographic and economic data about an individual in the FU. If the individual was head or wife
/ “wife”, much of the information in these variables is available among the family level variables,
often in substantially greater detail.

**The Building Blocks to Using PSID Data on Families & Individuals**

Because of the complexity of the PSID data structure, and its long-panel nature, there are a few
PSID concepts that are important to understand to effectively take advantage of the richness of
the data archive. This section of the chapter attempts to give you some background on these
concepts.

Let’s first review the PSID definition of “family”. The **Family Unit** ( **FU)** is defined as a group of
people living together as a family. “As a family” means to us that the individuals are generally
related by blood, marriage, or adoption, but unrelated persons can be part of a FU if they are
permanently living together and share both income and expenses. The **Household Unit (H** U), on
the other hand, is defined as the physical boundary, such as a house or apartment, where members
of the PSID FU reside. Not everyone living in a HU is automatically part of the FU. The PSID
survey is about FU Members only.

Families change from year to year. Each family unit in a specific data collection wave is assigned
a unique **Family ID**, sometimes called “ **Interview Number** ”. The most critical Family ID is the
one assigned in 1968 to families in the original sample. According to our following rules, we
follow “splitoffs” as children and others as they set up their households. One family in 1968 can
become 3-4 or more families by 2003. All of these families will have the same 1968 ID, since
they originated from the same family in 1968, but will have different family ID’s in 2003, since
they are separate family units in 2003.

For each family, the Family ID number will most certainly vary from year to year. For example, a
1968 family ID of 1234 will not likely be 1234 in 1969 or any other year for that matter. Yearly
IDs are assigned based on receipt of the interview—the first interview in from field is numbered
1, the second, 2, and so on. In the table on the next page, the “Smith Family” in 1968 had a
Family ID of “0100” and included five FU members: Jason and Andrea, and their three children
Julie, Anne, and Todd:

|The “Smiths” in 1968|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Family Unit Member|Age|1968 Family ID|
|Dad (Jason)|36|0100|
|Mom (Andrea)|35|0100|
|Julie|12|0100|
|Anne|10|0100|
|Todd|8|0100|



By 2003, Jason and Andrea’s children had moved out on their own, thus creating four families
out of this original 1968 “Smith Family”. Notice each family keep their original 1968 ID, but also
was assigned unique 2003 Family ID:


CDS-II User Guide Page 63


|The “Smiths” in 2003|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Families|68 ID|2003 Family ID<br>“Interview Number”|
|Jason (Dad) & Andrea (Mom)|0100|0834|
|Julie, her husband and son|0100|1004|
|Anne|0100|0971|
|Todd, his wife and daughter|0100|2202|


The PSID collects information about the **individuals** of each FU. In the Data Center, each
individual is uniquely identified by their combined **1968 ID** (labeled as ER30001 in the Data
Center) and **Person Number** (labeled as ER30002). At the time of data release for each wave of
the PSID, updates to Person Numbers are made. This is important to remember since it will
require updating of data files downloaded at a previous point-in-time.

The most information is collected about the Head of the household, the second most about the
wife (or “wife” in the scenario of a cohabiter for one year or more), and the least amount of detail
is collected about other family unit members (OFUMs), who are oftentimes the children in the
FU, but can also be boy/girl friends, grandparents, etc. All of the individuals in an FU have a
**Relationship to the Head** coded in the data files

.
As mentioned above, PSID gathers the most information about the **Head** of the FU. Within each
wave of data, each FU has only one current Head. The person designated as Head may change
over time as a result of other changes affecting the family. When a new Head must be chosen, the
following rules apply:

The Head of the FU must be at least 16 years old and the person with the most financial
responsibility for the FU. If this person is female and she has a husband in the FU, then he is
designated as Head. If she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least one year,
then he is Head. However, if the husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the
functions of Head, then the FU will have a female Head .

A new Head is selected in situations such as:

� Last year’s Head moved out of the HU (household unit), died or became incapacitated; or

� A female Head has gotten married; or

� An individual or group of individuals split-off to form a new FU (we’ll talk more about this
later).

The **Wife** is the spouse of the head; **“Wife”** is the cohabiter of one year or more. Much of the
information collected in the PSID about Heads is also collected about the Wives and “Wives”.

Continuing with our Smith Family example, Julie was one of the original sample members in
1968. She was the daughter of Jason (Head) back then. In 2003, she was living in her own FU,
Family ID 1004, with her husband and their child. Her relationship to Head is now Wife. Her
husband is Head, and their son is Child of Head.

Julie’s Family in 2003

|2003 Family ID|68 ID|Individuals|Relationship to Head|
|---|---|---|---|
|1004|0100|Julie (original 1968<br>sample member)|20 (Wife to Head)|
|1004|0100|Husband|10 (Head)|
|1004|0100|Son|30 (Child of Head)|



**Other Family Unit Members (OFUMs)** are the other individuals living in the family unit. Not
as much information is collected about OFUMs as Heads and Wives. Generally, the PSID main
interview provides individual level data on the OFUMs as well as data each wave about their:


� Demographic information, such as birth month and year, sex, date of death, family unit
status, wave-specific response status


� Marital and fertility histories, and cohabitation status


� Work status, number of jobs, occupation, weeks worked on job, during which months of
previous year (2004), hours per week


� Other income sources – (interest, TANF, SSI, welfare, social security, unemployment
compensation, worker’s compensation, child support, help from relatives)


� (For OFUMs 16 years and older) Date last attended school, currently enrolled as part time or
full time student, highest grade or year of school completed


� Health insurance coverage


Note that CDS “children” are OFUMs in the PSID data collections and are considered PSID
individuals. Data about them in the main PSID interviews can be merged onto CDS data files.

In CDS, the **primary and secondary caregivers are in relationship to the child** (variables
“RELPCG02” and RELOCG02” in 2002). If you are interested in merging data from PSID about
the caregivers, it is helpful to know the caregivers’ relationships to head. In some situations, the
data you are interested in may have only been collected for Heads and Wives. This accounts for
the majority of the PCG and OCGs.

Keeping in mind the PCG’s Relationship to Head, if you are interested in constructing, for
example, the PCG average work hours, you will find that PSID asks for this information and
stores it in three separate variables depending on the individual’s relationship to head:

HDAVG01 B79. And, on the average, how many _hours a week_ did you work on
your main job(s) in 2000? (HEAD)


WFAVG01 D79. And, on the average, how many _hours a week_ did she work on
her main job(s) in 2000? (WIFE) (exact same wording)


G81. During the weeks that (he/she) worked, about how many hours did (he/she)
usually work per week? (OFUM)


At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned that the PSID has a self-replacing sample design
whereby children are interviewed as their own family unit after they leave their parents’
households and ex-spouses and other adult sample members who move out of the family unit are


CDS-II User Guide Page 65


tracked to their new family units. With this design, at any wave, the PSID has main or “reinterview” families and split-off families. A **main family** is a family unit (FU) that was
interviewed in the prior wave. In a divorce or separation, the main family could be the family unit
of either spouse, depending on who was found first for the interview. In the case of children
leaving home, the main family is almost always the parental family. A **split-off family**, on the
other hand, consists of a person or group of people (at least one of whom is a “follow” person of
any age) who moved out from a main family since the prior wave’s interview to form a new,
economically independent family unit. Several criteria must be met for a split-off to occur. In
addition to having moved out since the prior wave, and to being ‘followable’ (i.e., having an
original 1968 family identification), the person or group of people have not moved to an
institution such as college or prison or to another family unit within the panel study. Moreover,
the person or group of people who have moved out and formed their own family unit must be
economically independent (i.e., they must be paying their own living expenses) from the family
unit from which they split off. Information that informs the criteria is gathered at the main family
interview, during the household listing stage. The main family Respondent provides these details.
It should be noted that these are general rules, and that sometimes unique situations arise that
determine whether a person or group of persons becomes a split-off. For example, while moving
to an institution such as college does not generally meet the criteria for becoming a split-off, if the
person is working, paying their own living expenses, and paying their own educational expenses
in addition to attending school, then this person would be considered a split-off. Information that
can inform this type of scenario is gathered in Section G of the main family interview and in the
interviewer observations. The living situation and interview data for each and every possible
split-off case are first reviewed before split-off status is granted.

**Family Composition Change**

When looking at variables pertinent to the same person(s) over time, the variable called
“Sequence Number” can be of help in understanding continuity and change in family composition
wave-to-wave. The **Sequence Number**, found in the individual file, identifies an individual’s
status with regard to the family unit at a given wave of data collection. The sequence number is
coded as follows:

1-20 indicates that the individuals in the family at the time of the current wave interview


51-59 indicates that the individuals were in institutions at the time of the current wave interview


71-80 indicates that the individuals moved out of the FU or out of institutions and established

their own households between the prior and current wave interview


81-89 indicates that the individuals died by the current interview but were living at the time of
the prior wave interview.


Page 66


PSID also has a variable (“ **Whether Moved In/Out** ”) to indicate whether the individual moved
in or out of a family unit in a given wave of data. The 2003 codebook definition below helps
illustrate the detail of this variable.

1 Moved in or born between the 2001 and 2003 interviews; split-off in 2003


2 Appeared; did not move in between the 2001 and 2003 interviews, but not included in FU

for 2001 (i.e., listing error)


5 Moved out of FU or out of an institution between the 2001 and 2003 interviews and was
not included in a 2003 panel FU


6 Moved out of FU and into an institution between the 2001 and 2003 interviews

7 Living in 2001 but died by the time of the 2003 interview

Disappeared; moved out prior to the 2001 interview, but included in FU for 2001 (usually a

8 listing error)


**PSID Data Center Files**

Most of the family and individual-level data on all waves of the PSID and CDS are housed in the
online Data Center. There are tutorials that provide a guided overview to utilizing the data. You
can create customized data sets and codebooks through the easy-to-use Data Center. More
information on using the Data Center is provided in Chapter 14.

_**Data Groupings**_
In the Data Center, you will find the data grouped by PSID main study data and CDS data. Within
the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family level files. The
individual level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data, mentioned earlier in this
chapter. The family-level files include not only “raw” interview data but also complex generated
variables on income, work, wealth, sample weights, and other measures. Data by wave of the
study are provided as the next level within each of the data groupings. In the CDS data group, the
data are clustered by child-level files, which include all of the interview modules, and by time
diary activity files, which are at the activity level.


CDS-II User Guide Page 67


**PSID Supplemental Files**

In addition to the data accessible through the on-line Data Center, PSID provides zipped files
with data that focus in detail on various aspects of the main study. These data are accessible
through the “PSID Packaged Supplemental Files” at
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data/zipSuppData.html. The Family History Files may be of
particular interest to CDS Data Users. These files provide information on biological and adoptive
parents, childbirth and adoption history, and (3) marriage history of the PSID individuals (of
interest for CDS – marriage history of the parents / caregivers). These files are updated at the time
of each PSID main study data release.

_**Parent Identification File**_

The Parent Identification File (PID) summarizes information collected from various sources since
the 1983 wave of the Panel PSID about parent-child relationships. This file contains relevant
identifiers for the child, his or her birth and adoptive parents, and information source indicators.
Linkages can be done from either the child’s standpoint – to find the identifiers of the CDS
child’s parents, or from the child’s parents’ standpoint, to find the CDS child’s grandparents’
identifiers. All CDS children have information about their parents on the Parent Identification
File (PID); however, note that a parent is necessarily the same person identified in the CDS as
primary caregiver (PCG).

_**Childbirth and Adoption History File**_

The Childbirth and Adoption History File contains all present-year and past-year detail about the
timing and circumstances of childbirths and adoptions up to and including the most current wave
of the PSID. In situations where an individual has never had or adopted children, there is one
record recording the fact that the individual has no such experience. Variables on this file include
the identifiers for each parent and child, month and year of birth for both parent and child, birth
order, birth weight and date of death for a child, year of most recent report and number of
births/adoptions, etc. Data on this file are structured in a one-record-per-event format, with each
record representing a specific childbirth or adoption event.

The 1999, 2001, and 2003 Family Files and the 1968-2003 Individual Files in the Data Center
also contain variables for number of childbirth, birth month and year of most children, identifiers
of mother and of father, whether the mother was married at the time the individual was born, and

birth order of individual .

_**Marriage History File**_
The 1985-2003 Marriage History File contains detailed information about marriages of people of
marriage-eligible ages living in a PSID family at the time of the interview in any wave between
1985 and 2003. Each record contains all past-year and most-recent-year detail about the timing
and circumstances of a marriage for a specified individual up to and including 2003 (or
whichever wave 1985-2003 when the individual was last in an interviewed family unit). Data on
this file are structured in a one-record-per-marriage format, with each record containing relevant
data about the spouse and timing of a specific marriage. In situations where an individual has
never been married, there is one record recording the fact that the individual has no marriages.
Variables on this file include the identifiers for each individual and his/her spouse, month and
year of marriages/divorce/widowhood, order of the specific marriage, total number of marriages
and the most recent year wave when data were collected.


Page 68


The PSID Individual Files in the Data Center also include variables for number of marriages,
beginning and end month and year for the first and the most recent marriages, marital status of the
individual at the time of the most recent interview, and the most recent wave when marriage data
were collected.

_**Geographic Residence and Environmental Characteristics**_
The PSID Geocode Match Files contain the identifiers necessary to link the main PSID data to
Census data. This linkage allows the addition of data on neighborhood characteristics for the
geographic areas in which panel individuals and families reside to the already rich socioeconomic
variables collected in the PSID. In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of external sources
that provide an increasing variety of measures of the social environment. Rather than investing
our resources in duplicating this effort, we are expecting users to seek out these sources to match
with the PSID files. Because the Geocode Match data are highly sensitive (usually pinpointing
the census tract in which families lived), this information is available only under special
contractual conditions designed to protect the anonymity of respondents.

## Chapter 13– Data File Structure within CDS Files

CDS-II data are stored in 13 groupings, each file specific to a CDS-II data collection module
described in Chapter 2 of this User Guide, with the addition of a background data file labeled
“Demographic File”. Except for Time Diary Activity file and Media File, the data are stored as
one record per child. Time Diary and Media File data are stored as one record per time use
activity (each child can have more than one activity record). Once you are in the Data Center, and
have selected “CDS” grouping, you will then see all of the possible data files listed, with a
selection box for each wave in which the data are available.
(http://simba.isr.umich.edu/ALL/selectcats.asp). The table in Appendix D provides an overview
of the 13 CDS data groupings.

The PCG Household and OCG Household data were collected at the family level, meaning if two
children in the same household were interviewed for CDS-II, the household interview was
administered only once to the PCG and once to the OCG (if applicable). To keep all of the CDS
files at the child-level, as done in the CDS-I, we applied the household data to each response
target child household, resulting in one data record per child in the data files you will find on the
PSID-CDS Data Center. The sibling indicator in the CDS-II Demographic File gives you
information on whether a specific CDS response child has a response sibling in the CDS-II. Note
that Family ID accompanies data downloads.

The PCG Child Interview was required for the CDS target child to be considered “response” in
the CDS-II data collection. The other interview modules were completed based on eligibility and
cooperation with appropriate respondent in the home or school. The data files are structured to
reflect this study design.

In the 2002 Demographic file, you will find a set of indicator variables for assessment, child, time
diary, OCG and teacher modules that specify (a) if a case was eligible for that module and (b) if a
record exists for that case in the corresponding data file. These variables are helpful when you
merge variables from multiple CDS modules. The sample weight in the Demographic file can be
used to adjust for unit nonresponse at the child level. The module indicator variables, however,
will inform you about item missing data across modules. It is up to you to then decide on your
preferred approach for addressing item missing data that results from differential response rates
across modules (for example, you may leave it as missing, impute data, etc).

To review, each response target child has a data record in the PCG child file, and every data
record from each of the other data files has a corresponding record in the PCG Child interview
file. You will not find a data record in any of these modules that is not in the PCG Child data file.

On the other hand, not every targeted child with a completed PCG Child interview has a
completed interview for each (or any) of the other modules. There are two reasons for this: (a) the
child was not eligible for a specific module, or (b) the child was eligible but did not complete the
specific module. For instance, children under eight years of age were not eligible for a Child
interview and thus do not have a corresponding record in the Child interview file. Children who
were eight years or older and had a PCG interview completed for them, but refused to participate
themselves in an interview likewise do not have a record in the Child interview file but do have

one in the PCG Child data file.

Variable names were kept as similar as possible and variable labels the same or as similar as
possible in CDS-II as to CDS-I for convenience in referencing variables. Variable labels in CDS

Page 70


II have “02” at the end. For example, one of the behavior problem index items Q21B30D is
labeled “CURIOUS 02” in CDSII, and its companion variable in CDS-I, Q1G24D, is labeled
“CURIOUS”.

Variable names in CDS-II start with “Q2x” (x=1–9). For example, variable Q21A3“HOSPITALIZATION 02” is from CDS 2002 PCG Child interview (indicated by “Q21” in the
variable name and “02” in the variable label), Question A3.

On the CDS website, we have posted an excel table that serves as a cross-wave index, mapping
maps the individual variables across the two waves of the CDS. This file is located at:
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/questionnaires/pcgchild_xyr.pdf. You can also download
codebooks from the Data Center or review on-line when selecting variables. Codebooks give
exact question wording and complete code frame .

## Chapter 14 – Using the Data Center and Merging Files

With exception of sensitive data contract files, all PSID and CDS data are located on the PSIDCDS Data Center. In this chapter, we provide you with a basic step-by-step guide to using the
Data Center. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, there are also tutorials on the website that are
helpful to understanding basic structural concepts in the data

(seehttp://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data/DataCenterHilites.ppt,http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Gu
ide/tutorials/tutorials_home.html). While all of the CDS data are located within the Data Center,
some PSID data are located in zipped files (see http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data). The
codebook and read-me file that accompany each supplemental data file are detailed enough to
illustrate the data structure and content of the files. Towards the end of this chapter, we give you
some basic information on merging data across the PSID and CDS.

In addition to actual data about the CDS child and his/her family, there are a number of tools on
the PSID-CDS website that facilitate use of the data, such as the Caregiver Map and the Family
Identification Mapping System. This chapter gives an overview of how these tools function. Let’s
start with a few basic concepts of the Data Center.

**Using the Data Center: The Basics**

The underlying premise of the Data Center is to facilitate the selection of variables from both the
CDS and the PSID panel, across multiple data collection years, and to output the data in a format
that fits your specific analytic needs. More specifically, there are six main functions within the
PSID-CDS Data Center that facilitate building a data file. These functions are: 1) automatic
downloading and merging of multiple waves of PSID data to create PSID-CDS datasets; 2)
customized codebooks in many formats; 3) subsetting option for certain types of individuals or
families; 4) intergenerational dataset creation for CDS children and PSID family members; 5)
data cart management; and 6) search and browse functions. The following section will describe
these functions as we show you how to create customized data sets and codebooks using nearly
50,000 variables across the (current to this writing) 34 waves of PSID data (19682003), two
waves of CDS data (1997 and 2002).

_**Data Groups**_

The PSID-CDS Data Center stores data for PSID and CDS into groupings of variables. In the
PSID, data groups are mainly categorized as individual level data (time-invariant grouping and
PSID individual grouping) and family level data, which includes data from the questionnaire and
data from constructed measures (e.g., Income Plus, Work Hours and Wages, etc.). In the CDS,
data groups mainly follow data the collection modules. The structure of the CDS data files is
described in the previous chapter. Mainly, all files except for Time Diaries are child-level files,
with one data record per participating CDS child. When you select data from the CDS grouping,
you final output file should have up to 3,563 data records if you selected from CDS-I grouping, or
2,907 records if you selected from CDS-II data.

If you select variables from both PSID and CDS data groupings, your data file is structured as one
record per CDS child, with PSID individual or family variables attached to each record.
Individual level data from PSID is this scenario is about the child, and family level data is about
the family unit in which the child resided in that data collection year, and the head or the wife of
the child’s family unit. Later in this chapter we discuss merging on PSID individual data about
the child’s parents and caregivers.


Page 72


_**Welcome to the Data Center!**_

When arriving at the Data Center’s homepage, you will see there are four ways to add variables to
your cart: 1) By File; 2) By Topical Index; 3) By Search; or 4) By Cart.


_**Selecting Variables by File**_

When adding by file, you will use the drill-down interface to eventually select specific variables
from PSID/CDS and add them to your data cart. You must first, however, select the Data
Group(s) of interest from PSID, CDS, or both. In our example, we select the “PSID Family-level”
data group and the “CDS” data group:


CDS-II User Guide Page 73


_**Wave of Data**_

Expanding these selections even further allows you to view the specific waves, or years, of data
that are available for each selected data group from both the PSID and CDS. You can build your
data file by selecting any number of waves of data from the PSID and CDS. PSID currently has
34 waves of data in the Data Center and CDS has two waves.


The next step is to then select data year(s) of interest from each data group. In our example on the
next page, we selected 2003 data from “PSID Main Family Data” and 2002 data from CDS
“Demographic File” and “Primary Caregiver Child File.”


Page 74


_**Variable Selection**_

The third step to creating your PSID-CDS data file is to actually select the variables of interest
and add them to your data cart. You can select as few or as many from each of the data groupings
you have already chosen. In our example, we select “ER24080 – HEAD TOTAL HOURS OF
WORK LAST YEAR” (the Head’s total work hours in the previous year (2002)) from the 2003
PSID Family File. From the CDS 2002 Demographic File we select “RELPCG02” &
“RELOCG02” (the relationship of the PCG and OCG to the child), and “CH02PRWT,” (the
child’s sample weight in 2002). NOTE: to select more than one variable, press and hold Control.
We also select all ten variables belonging to the Behavior Problem Index (BPI), “Q21B29A”
through “Q21B29J,” from the CDS 2002 Primary Caregiver File. Once you have selected all
desired variables by highlighting them, click the “Add To Cart” button located at the top of the

page.


CDS-II User Guide Page 75


_**Review of Data Selections**_

The next step is to review the selections you have chosen by viewing your data cart. Clicking the
blue “your cart” link will take you to a summary of the variables you have chosen. Clicking
“Expand All” will provide you with a detailed list of all selected variables, and allows you to
delete any that are unwanted.


Notice that the Data Center automatically appends certain key individual and family identifier
variables to the data set, such as “ER30001,” “ER33603,” and “ER33701.” These variables,
which are described in depth in Chapter 12, are important to understanding relationships within
the family and to the family head.

_**Output Options**_
After finalizing your variables, “Checkout” your data cart. In this step you can specify the type of
format for your codebook and data file outputs, and also name your file. In our example we select
a PDF codebook and a SAS data file, and name our file “Behavior Problems”.


Page 76


Additionally, under “Cart Options,” you may elect to have the Data Center notify you via email
after your data have been created and provide you with a link to your output files. This option
allows saving data carts for future use.

You may also decide it is necessary to limit the sample to cases where one or more variables are
in specific value ranges to define a subset of observations. To subset the data, enter the
appropriate command in the “Subsetting Criteria” box in the Output Options section of the data
selection process.

If the email option is not elected, the Data Center will create the specified files and allow you to
view, download, and save them.


CDS-II User Guide Page 77


_**Selecting Variables by Topical Index**_

A second approach to selecting variables in the Data Center is by Topical Index. This method
also employs a drill-down tree interface that allows you to browse through the many topical
categories of variables and chose the desired waves of data available for those selected.


In this example, we will again attempt to select the Behavior Problem Index variables from the
2002 CDS. Expanding the “CDS Variables” data group leads us to the “Problem Behaviors”
category, which contains the Behavior Problem Index.


Expanding the “PCG Reported” BPI lists the 39 possible variables in this topic, and allows you to
directly select as many or as few of the variables for any combination of waves available. We can
see that CDS data for these variables is available for the 1997 and 2002 waves. NOTE: If you are
unsure about what wave you are selecting, float your mouse over the checkbox in question to
display the year. In our example, we select the following: “Cries too Much,” “Demands
attention,” & “Destructive” for 1997, and “Anxious” & “Destructive” for 2002. Once you have
selected all desired variables by checking the appropriate boxes, click the “Add to Cart” button
located at the top of the page.


Page 78


As before, you may follow the blue “your cart” link and “Expand All” to get a detailed summary
of the contents in your data cart, including the variables you selected, and the key relational
identifier variables the Data Center appends automatically.


Lastly, “Checkout” your cart, select your output options, and retrieve your customized data files.

_**Selecting Variables by Search**_

A third approach to selecting variables is to use the Search feature, which allows you to search
codebook text for all variables in the Data Center. You may select any combination of Data File
Types and Data Years, as well as specify the text field types it searches against. You may search
against variable names, variable labels, question text & explanation text (notes about the question
wording or variable construction), or all of the above.

In our example, we look for the phrase “Behavior Prob” in the Question/Explanation text fields
for variables in the 1997 and 2002 CDS data group.


CDS-II User Guide Page 79


The engine generates a list of all records of the BPI index for 1997 and 2002, including such
variables as the internalizing and externalizing scale, and total BPI score. Clicking “Check All”
and “Add To Cart” will deposit the variables into the Data Cart, which we can then review and
output into the desired format(s).


**Linking Data Files**


There are a large number of variables in the PSID that can be used along with CDS. Every
individual in the PSID has both an “ID68” (1968 Family Identifier) and “PN” (Person Number)
that when combined, uniquely identify that individual. Identifier variables are available through a
“CDS Caregiver Map” that is created automatically whenever CDS and/or PSID individual-level
data are downloaded, and through the Family Identification Mapping System. Let’s start with the
Child-to-Caregiver Map file.

_**CDS Caregiver Map**_

An integral aspect of the CDS research design is to collect information about the children’s
caregivers. Typically, the caregivers are the children’s biological or adoptive parents, but not


Page 80


always. We define the primary caregiver as the person living with the child who has primary
responsibility for caring for that child, and the secondary caregiver as the person living with the
child who assumes secondary responsibility for caring for that child. Under this definition, nonbiological parents may assume a central caregiver role in the child’s life.

Since the caregivers reside with the CDS child by study definition, information about them is
collected in the main PSID. To make linkages possible between the rich panel data in the PSID
data archive and the CDS, we provide a file with unique individual identifiers for the CDS child,
primary caregiver, and secondary caregiver that is automatically appended to any Data Center
download of CDS data. The map file always has the same name as the data download, with
“map” in the filename. For example, if your data file name is “job39350.txt”, your map data file
would be “map39350.txt”.

The file is formatted as a flat file, with one record per CDS individual. Every individual in the
PSID has both a 1968 Family Identifier or “ID68” and Person Number or “PN” that when
combined, uniquely identify that individual. In the Data Center, these variables are “ER30001 –
1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER” (ID68) and “ER30002 – PERSON NUMBER 68” (PN). The first
two columns of the map file are ER30001 and ER30002, which are the 1968 Family Identifier
and Person Number, respectively, of the child. The next two variables, PCGID97 and PCGPN97,
represent the ER30001 (1968 Family ID) and ER30002 (Person Number) of the individual
identified as the primary caregiver of the child in 1997. The next two variables OCGID97 and
OCGPN97, represent the ER30001 (1968 Family ID) and ER30002 (Person Number) of the
individual identified as the other caregiver of the child in 1997. Missing data points on the OCG
variables indicates that a secondary caregiver who is in the PSID followable sample was not
identified for that year.

The PCG and OCG variables are repeated in the next four columns, but here, represent the
identifiers for CDS-II (2002-2003) data collection. Note that missing data points on PCG 2002
identifiers indicate that the CDS child did not participate in the second wave. Missing data points
on the OCG 2002 identifiers indicate either (a) the CDS child did not participate in the second
wave, or (b) a secondary caregiver who is in the PSID followable sample was not identified for
that year. You can determine whether a secondary caregiver was in the home at the time of the
CDS-II interview with variable RELOCG02 on the CDS-II Demographic data file. Table 1 is an
example “map file” output.

Table 1: Excerpt from the CDS Caregiver Map File


CDS-II User Guide Page 81


In the example above, the primary caregiver for the first child listed, “0655”-“030” is “0655”“172” in both CDS-I and CDS-II. The secondary caregiver for child “0655”-“030” is “0655”“003” in both waves as well. There are two ways to determine the relationship of the caregivers to
the child. The first is to use the variables on the CDS Demographic data files “RELPCG97/02”
and “RELOCG97/02”. This information was reported by the PCG during the CDS data
collections. The second approach is to use the “Relationship to Head” variables on the PSID
individual files to map a relationship of the child to the caregiver through both of their
relationships to the person designated as the “Head” of the family.

To use the CDS caregiver map file for merging data about the caregivers onto CDS child-level
file, you need to create data files about each of the caregivers, merge onto the map file, then
merge onto the CDS child-level file. First, identify the variables about the PCG and the OCG that
are of relevance to your analysis. The cross-year index in the Data Center
(http://simba.isr.umich.edu/VS/i.aspx) is an excellent tool for selecting measures within specific
substantive domains across multiple waves of the PSID. Keep in mind that some characteristics
of the PCG and OCG may be in the PSID Individual File, and some may be in the PSID Family
Files if these individuals are Heads (and Wives) of PSID families. Chapter 12 of the CDS-II User
Guide provide information on PSID respondent roles and data structure – this is a good place to
start to get acquainted with the PSID content prior to selecting data.

Once a data file about the PCG and a data file about the OCG are created, merge these files onto
your CDS map file by using ID68 and PN for each of the caregivers as the primary keys for
merging. The last step is to merge these files onto the CDS data file you have downloaded from
the PSID-CDS Data Center. Use ER30001 and ER30002 as the primary keys for merging. The
end result is a data file with all of the CDS variables that you have selected for your analyses and
the identifiers for the caregivers.

_**Family Identification Mapping**_
As mentioned earlier, caregivers are usually, but not always, biological or adoptive parents. There
may be times when you want to know about biological or adoptive parents only or grandparents.
In the fall of 2006, PSID incorporated a new data extraction tool on the PSID-CDS website
(http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/FIMS) called the “Family Identification Mapping System” or
“FIMS”. FIMS facilitates the process of constructing a data file with identifiers for pre-specified
relationships to PSID individuals. For example, by using the FIMS, you can easily create a
customized inter-generational identification map with identifiers for parents, grandparents, or
great grandparents.

This section describes how the FIMS constructs Inter-Generation Identification (GID) data files.
The FIMS uses the _Parent Identification File or “PID”_, a supplemental PSID data file that
summarizes information about parent-child relationships in its “behind-the-scenes” extraction
process. The PID contains relevant identifiers for the child and his or her birth and adoptive
parents for all individuals in the PSID (not just the CDS children), including both sample and
nonsample individuals. More information about the original construction of PID and its updating
process is available in the “Parent Identification Introduction” documentation (see URL:
http://simba.isr.umich.edu/Zips/ZipSupp.aspx#MH). A brief description of the file and how
individual family members are followed across time and generations in the PSID is available in
Chapter 12 of the CDS-II User Guide.


Page 82


To illustrate the FIMS process for creating a GID data file, we will use an example for selecting
_biological parents and grandparents of the CDS children_ . The final output file will have one data
record per individual with biological parent and grandparent identifiers, where available, on each
record. Let’s get started.

**Step 1: Getting to FIMS**

The FIMS extraction tool is part of the data sharing resources on the PSID-CDS website. You can
access FIMS from http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/FIMS. To begin the process of constructing a
GID file with parent and grandparent identifiers of CDS sample members, select “Intergeneration (GID)” under “Select Map Type”, the first selection box on the FIMS home page.
Options for further specification will then appear.

**Step 2: Select Parent-Type**


Under “Parents” drop box, select “biological parents”.


FIMS uses in its “behind the scenes” extraction. While the FIMS draws upon the PID as the
initial source of information in creating GID data files, there are important differences between
what the PID and the FIMS offer. These differences are highlighted as we describe how the FIMS
tool works. The FIMS relies on PID variables that contain the 1968 Family Identifier (“interview
number”) and Person Number for all PSID individuals and their parents of interest (i.e., variables
PID1-2; PID3-4; PID5-6; PID17-18; PID1920). As described earlier, the combination of the 1968
Family Identifier and Person Number unique identify each individual in the PSID. There are
78,902 individuals in the PID data file, Data Release #4. Recall that there are 3,563 CDS-I
participants enrolled at the baseline interview in 1997.


The example in this document focuses on selecting _biological parents and grandparents of the_
_CDS children_ . The PID contains information about adoptive parents and likewise, in the FIMS,
you can specify adoptive parents for your output identification map file. For our example,
however, we are focusing on biological parents. Table 2 below shows the PID input data for
biological parents that the FIMS would draw upon. The data are shown for PSID family “2069”
and are current as of the 2003 wave of the PSID. Data points with a value of “0” on the PID


CDS-II User Guide Page 83


represent a lack of available information about that individual or in the case of adoptive parents,
possibility that the individual does not have an adopted mother / father. From the table below, we
see that Family “2069” has 20 individual members. There are identification numbers for
biological mothers for 14 of the individuals and identification numbers for biological fathers for
nine of the individuals.
Table 2: Data Values from PID for PSID Family 2069


Next, FIMS selects information for all individuals in the PID who have ever been a part of a
PSID family unit. These are the individuals about whom PSID has collected data. Recall that the
purpose of FIMS is to facilitate the development of analytic files for exploring intergenerational
patterns on a wide range of topics measured in the PSID and CDS. If an individual never resided
in a PSID family and data were never collected about them, then we would not be able to include
them in analysis. Hence they are not included in FIMS. They are, however, included on the PID.
We can identify these individuals by their Person Number: range of 900-990. From the PID
codebook, person numbers are defined as:


**PN Code** **Code Description**

1 - 19 Individuals living in core sample families at the time of the 1968 interview; individuals
living in Latino sample families at the time of the 1990 (or 1992) interview; individuals

900-990 Child who has never been in any sample family.

The Person Number range of 1 to 399 (actual data range 1-231 for PID Release # 4) represents
individuals that have resided in family units and are thus included in FIMS. There are 78,902
individuals listed in the PID, but 65,332 have a person number under 900 and are thus included in
FIMS.

When we select CDS-I baseline participant data records (n=3,563) from the PID, we find that all
CDS individuals have a person number in the range of 1-231 and are thus included in FIMS. In
terms of biological parents, there are four CDS children whose biological mothers have a PN
greater than 900 and have thus never resided in a PSID family and 64 CDS children for whom we
do not have data on biological mothers (PN=0). There are seven CDS children whose biological
fathers have a PN greater than 900 and 833 CDS children for whom we do not have data on


CDS-II User Guide Page 85


biological fathers (PN=0). The net result is that as of the 2003 PSID Data Release, there are
biological mother identifiers for 3,495 CDS-I baseline participants and biological father
identifiers for 2,723 CDS-I baseline participants in the FIMS.

To illustrate, table 2 shows the individuals in the PID for Family 2069 who would be excluded
from FIMS since they never resided in a PSID family unit. These excluded individuals with a PN
greater or equal to 900 are represented below as “.”. There are three individuals, four biological
mothers, and five biological fathers. We would not expect to find these individuals in the FIMS
output, nor would we expect to find the biological mothers and fathers who are coded as “0” in
PID.


**Step 3: Select Generation Map**


The next step is to select a map that will provide identifiers for CDS children, their biological
parents, and their biological grandparents. Under “Generation Map” drop box, select “Individual
to Grandparents”. In this scenario, “grandparent” is the farthest reaching generation. The output
file will provide identifiers for the individuals, their parents, and grandparents.


Page 86


The process for identifying grandparents is similar to the process described above for identifying
parents. Essentially, FIMS iterates the extraction, this time focusing on _parents of parents_, or
grandparents. Because we have selected “Biological Only” under “Parents” drop box, our
example is focused on biological parents and grandparents.


To execute this request, FIMS looks at each individual in the PID and finds biological parents and
grandparents. Table 4 on the next page shows the generational linkage that FIMS would output
for PSID Family “2069”. Each individual from family “2069” is listed under “ID68.PN” – a
combination variable of ER30001 and ER30002. Take a look back at Table 3 to see the
correspondence between the input data and output data.


The next variable in Table 4 is the Generation Number. Note that some individuals in Family
“2069” are third generation individuals. The next column, “Ancestor to Individual Link Path”
shows the lineage. Looking back at individual “2069” “030”, we see the mother and grandmother
of individual 2069.030 are listed on the first line, and the parents (mother first, father second)
listed on the next two lines. For Family “2069”, there are eight individuals with identifiers for at
least one biological parent, and three individuals with identifiers for at least one biological
grandparent.


Table 4: Individual, GID and Generation Linkage and Parent Type in FIMS for Family
“2069”Out of the CDS-I baseline participants, there are 3,495 biological mothers, 2,723
biological fathers, and 3,043 biological grandparents with identifiers in the FIMS and data in the
PSID archive.

**Step 4: Select Generation Map Type and Format**


The last step is to select a map type and file format. Under “Map Type” drop box, you can select
“balanced” or “unbalanced” map. A generation map with non-missing data from any generation is
called balanced generation map. A generation map with missing data from the higher generation
selected is called unbalanced generation map. For the output example on the next page, we
selected “unbalanced”.

Under “File Format”, select a wide or long file, depending on whether you want to work with a
file that has one observation per individual (wide), or one observation per relationship (long). If
you are linking with your CDS data file, select WIDE and then check the box that says “Merge
with CDS Map”. This will give you relationships only for CDS-I baseline participants. Under
“Output Options”, you can select your analysis program format – SAS, SPSS, Stata, or Excel.


Page 88


Among the variables that will be outputted in your GID file from FIMS are the identifiers for
biological parents and grandparents. Note that maternal and paternal grandparents are identified
separately.

```
ER30001  LABEL="CHILD: 1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER"

ER30002  LABEL="CHILD: PERSON NUMBER 68"

ER30001_P_F  LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /PARENT /FATHER"
ER30002_P_F  LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /PARENT /FATHER"
ER30001_P_M  LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /PARENT /MOTHER"
ER30002_P_M  LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /PARENT /MOTHER"
ER30001_GP_FF LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF FATHER"
ER30002_GP_FF LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF FATHER"
ER30001_GP_FM LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF MOTHER"
ER30002_GP_FM LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /FATHER OF MOTHER"
ER30001_GP_MF LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF FATHER"
ER30002_GP_MF LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF FATHER"
ER30001_GP_MM LABEL="1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF MOTHER"
ER30002_GP_MM LABEL="PERSON NUMBER 68 /GRANDPARENT /MOTHER OF MOTHER"

```

For GID data files that are merged with the CDS Map, you will also get the primary and
secondary caregiver ID68 and PN variables. You are then ready to link your map file with your
CDS child-level file – the linkage should be done with ER30001 and ER30002 combined, the
unique identifiers per CDS individual and will follow the same steps as described above for
caregiver map file.

## Chapter 15 – A Few Tips on Using the PSID-CDS Data Resources

Admittedly, the PSID-CDS data are complex data resources that may appear difficult to use at
first glance. The key to using the CDS and PSID data, however, lies in understanding the basic
data structure before jumping in and downloading variables across multiple years of collection for
multiple individuals in the child’s family.

Remember that CDS children are individuals in the PSID panel of families where we collected
more in-depth information about them, individually, where the main PSID data collection does
not. This means that the CDS kids have data in the PSID main archive (not just the parents or
caregivers) as well as in the CDS-specific data collections (including CDS-I, CDS-II, and TA
2005).

In the PSID, the data are collected at a family level, with some individual-level details. But the
bulk of the data revolve around the persons who are Heads and Wives of the households. In the
CDS, the data are collected mainly at the individual-level, revolving around the children. Some
information, however, is collected about the caregivers / parents, who may be Heads or Wives in
the PSID. A first tip to using the data is to review the chapters on PSID and CDS data structure in
this guide to get a firm grasp on data structure for both data collections. It is well-worth the time
investment to become familiar with basic concepts prior to attempting data downloads so you
know what to expect and how to merge.

The CDS itself has multiple modules, collected from multiple individuals in the family. The User
Guides provide survey and sample design information, historical context of the study,
documentation about specific scales and indices that the CDS staff generated for public use, and
data structure of the PSID. Questionnaires are also posted for both CDS and PSID. For detailed
listing of measures by module, and for a comparison of measures with other large-scale public
use datasets on children and adolescents, see:

http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/researchdesign.html

.
Questionnaires are provided on web pages:


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/quescodetable.html (for CDS)
and http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Data/zipCore.aspx for PSID
questionnaires.


We additionally encourage you to review the “Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for both PSID
and CDS: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/FAQ.aspx. This webpage gives a quick overview
of some key concepts in both projects.


Next, take the opportunity to review the tutorials posted on the PSID website. These tutorials
provide step-by-step instructions on downloading and analyzing the data in a variety of ways,
including: cross-sectional analyses, tracking longitudinal changes, creating and analyzing a
balanced panel, creating and analyzing a customized subset of CDS modules, and merging PSID
and CDS data together for intergenerational analysis. These tutorials also help to understand


Page 90


PSID file structure, identification numbers, and how to obtain caregiver data about the CDS target
children/youth. They can be found at:

http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/Tutorials/tutorials_home.html.

The Data Center is the most popular means for obtaining PSID data, and it delivers about 10,000
customized data files to researchers and quantitative social science students each year. The Data
Center is fully automated and allows for user-specified subsetting criteria when downloading and
merging main family and main individual data files. ASCII or SAS data files can be generated,
along with SAS, SPSS, and Stata data definition statements.

In addition to the Data Center, data and documentation can also be obtained from the PSID Web
site in the form of prepackaged files. Data files and SAS and SPSS data definition statements are
available via the documentation page and Anonymous FTP. Data from the Geocode files, Death
files, and Medicare files are available by special contract. See the PSID Overview page or contact
PSID Help for more information.

Each time you go to the Data Center to download data, visit the Data News page
http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/DataNews.aspx to see if any modifications to existing files
or new files have been posted. Sign up for email alerts when new data or data sharing tools are
released.

of the summary variable for Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales in the CDS-II data. An empty shade cell indicates that the item is not part of
the NLSY subscale and therefore not used in the construction of the summary variable for Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales in the CDS-II
data. An italic question number indicates that the item was asked of the cohort, and it is part of the NLSY subscale, but it was not used to construct the summary
variable for Emotional Support and Cognitive Stimulation subscales in the CDS-II data because of a significant number of missing data.

## Appendix E: Documentation for CDS Media Files

In 1997, the PSID supplemented its main data collection with additional information on 0-12 year-old children and their parents in a study entitled
"The Child Development Supplement" (CDS). The objective was to provide researchers with a comprehensive, nationally representative,
longitudinal data base of children and their families with which to study the dynamic process of early human capital formation. The CDS has
collected information on this sample at three points in time – the initial wave was in 1997 (CDS-I), a second wave was collected when the children
were 5 years older, aged 5-18 in 2002/2003, and a third and final wave was collected in 2007/2008 when the children where 10-18. More
information about the study and data are provided in the CDS User Guides: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/wavesdoc.html.
The time diaries are one of the unique features of the CDS survey design. With the assistance of their primary care giver when needed, CDS
children completed a set of time diaries as part of their involvement in the overall CDS data collection effort: one diary for a randomly selected
weekday (Monday-Friday) and another for a randomly selected weekend day (Saturday or Sunday). The time diaries provide detailed accounting
of the type, number, duration, and location of activities during sampled 24-hour days, beginning at midnight. The time diaries additionally
collected information on the social context of the activity by specifying with whom the child was doing the activity and who else was present, but
not engaging, and the names of television shows watched by the children.

The Center for Research on Interactive Technology, Television and Children (CRITC) at the University of Texas at Austin coded the television
programs that were reported in the 1997 and 2002 CDS Time Diaries. The television coding manual and the data files are now available. This
document describes the data structure and coding procedures. For clarification questions, please contact Dr. Elizabeth Vandewater at
evandewater@mail.utexas.edu.

Data Structure
The data file is structured at the activity level. There is one record per media activity with a valid content code for each of the weekday / weekend
diaries for each child for each wave of data collection (1997 data and 2002 data are kept in separate files). Key identifier variables that will help
you link the media codes back to the main time diary activity file are as follows (these are wave specific).

Unique Identifiers for 1997 Data:
TD97M02 1997 Interview Number (corresponds to ER33401)
TD97M03 1997 Sequence Number (corresponds to ER33402)
TD97M04 Type of Diary (corresponds to WDAYWEND)
TD97M05 Start Time (corresponds to COLB)
TD97M06 End Time (corresponds to COLC)


CDS-II User Guide Appendix - Page 33


Unique Identifiers for 2002 Data:
TD02M02 2001 Interview Number (corresponds to ER33601)
TD02M03 2001 Sequence Number (corresponds to ER33602)
TD02M04 Type of Diary (corresponds to DIARY_02)
TD02M05 Start Time (corresponds to COLB_02)
TD02M06 End Time (corresponds to COLC_02)

Outcome Variables
There are eight variables generated by the media coding project: (1) Format (TD97M09, TD02M09); (2) Intended Audience (TD97M10,
TD02M10); (3) Character Age (TD97M11, TD02M11); (4) Genre (TD97M12, TD02M12); (5) Comedy (TD97M13, TD02M13); (6) Science
Fiction, Fantasy or Supernatural/Paranormal (SF/F/SP) (TD97M14, TD02M14); (7) Curriculum (TD97M15, TD02M15); and (8) Violence
(TD97M16, TD02M16) of each television program. Please consult the codebook for a description of these variables for each wave. Please
consult the "TV Coding Manual.pdf" file for a description of the coding process.

Merging the Media Data with Data Center Data
The data contained in the CDS Media supplement is a subset of the same-year CDS time diary records for whom time diary data was collected in
1997 and 2002. A record exists in the CDS Media file only if the corresponding diary record had an activity code of 'TV' (activity code 919 for
variable COLA in 1997; activity code 9190 for variable COLA_02 in 2002). Records which had an activity code of 919/9190 but which did not
have a codeable response for which program was watched will have missing data for the media variables for that record.
To link the CDS Media file to the unaggregated time diary records from the data center, you must sort and merge on the five unique identifier
variables listed above (TD97M02-06 for 1997; TD02M02-06 for 2002). Note: there will be some records in the unaggregated CDS Media file
which do not initially appear to have an exact match in the unaggregated main time diary file. These are records which the media coders split into
multiple entries based on two or more distinctly different TV programs being recorded in the original activity record. When combined or
aggregated, these split records will provide the same overall duration of television viewing for that diary. For example:

Example from the unaggregated media file:
TD02M02 TD02M03 TD02M04 TD02M05 TD02M06

122 36       0      34200    36000

122 36       0      36000    37800

122 36       0      37800    38400


Appendix – Page 34


Example from the unaggregated data center file:
ER33601 ER33602  DIARY_02  COLB_02  COLC_02
122       36 0       34200      38400

Note that the start-time (TD02M05) of the first record from the media file and the end-time (TD02M06) of the last record from the media file
match the start- and end-times of the record from the data center file (COLB_02 and COLC_02), while the remaining start- and end-times for the
media file records define time intervals in between. In this example, an activity record of 4200 seconds duration (70 minutes) in the data center
file is divided into three activity records of 1800 seconds, 1800 seconds, and 600 seconds duration (30, 30, and 10 minutes) respectively in the
media file.
Note that, in some instances, multiple sets of split records exist for some entries, but when collapsed or cross-referenced as outlined above, these
records combine for the same overall duration. For example:

Example from the unaggregated media file:
ER30001  ER30002  TD97M04  TD97M05  TD97M06

209 30       0 33300     34200

209 30       0 34200     36000

209 30       0 38700     39600

209 30       0 39600     40500

Example from the unaggregated data center file:
ER30001  ER30002  WDAYWEND   COLB   COLC

209     30     0    33300  36000

209     30     0    38700  40500

A complete listing of all of the split records from both the 1997 and 2002 CDS Media files as well as the corresponding unaggregated data center
records is provided for reference purposes:

CDS-II User Guide Appendix - Page 35


If CDS Media file records are aggregated to the diary level, and are merged with aggregated records from the data center, this discrepancy goes

away.

Note: to create a cross-year file containing both of these files, first you must merge each media file with time diary data from the data center for
the corresponding year (1997 with 1997, 2002 with 2002). Then you can merge the two files using the unique Individual File identifiers:
ER30001, ER30002.

Additional Documentation

An aggregated listing of television show titles and the corresponding Curriculum code (TD97M15, TD02M15) assigned to them is provided for
reference purposes. Note that the text values of the titles are provided as-is and can contain typos, abbreviations, etc. Also note, these values have
been recoded to match the coding scheme of the final release data set.
