**The PSID-CDS Design At-A-Glance**


**General Purpose**


To provide researchers with a comprehensive, nationally representative, and longitudinal database of children and
their families with which to study the dynamic process of early human capital formation.


**Sample Design**


� Sampled all PSID families with children aged 0-12 years during the calendar year of 1997. PSID is a
nationally representative sample of families in the U.S. with an oversample of low-income families.
Interviews have been collected with PSID families since 1968. Sample members are followed as they split
off into new households. Up to three generations of data are currently available.


� Selected up to 2 children per PSID family. CDS Families typically included biological mother (94% of CDS-I
and 89% of CDS-II) but also include other “non-traditional” family configurations.


� Large and representative sample of siblings and cousins


� Interviewed CDS children in 1997, 2002-2003, 2005 Transition into Adulthood (TA), and planned (per
funding decision) 2007 CDS and TA. Note CDS follows individuals only to the extent that the families are
followable. CDS retention after five yrs is 84%.


� Respondents in CDS include:


–
Children (computer-assisted IW and self-IW)


–
Both parents/caregivers in the home at all waves


– Absent father at Wave 1


–
Teachers (elementary, pre-school, home-school)


–
School administrators, Wave 1


� Respondents in PSID biennial interview:


–
Parents, grandparents, and other extended family members, providing information on family context
