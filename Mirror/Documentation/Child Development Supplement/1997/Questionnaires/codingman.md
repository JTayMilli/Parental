TIME DIARY GENERAL EDITING INSTRUCTIONS


All diary activity editing is to be done in red pencil.


If editing causes additional activity lines to be added, number the additional ones as follows, using
decimals: if activity 5 is edited to three activities, they should be numbered 5, 5.1, 5.2.


T1 Day of the Week (from the attached label)


1 Monday 6 Saturday
2 Tuesday 7 Sunday
3 Wednesday
4 Thursday
5 Friday


A1-A3 Make sure these items are legibly marked or written in.


COLUMN A What did your child do?


Use the Activity Code list (pp. 16-33)
EXCEPT:

If R has given no activities or 1 or 2 activities for the whole day, NA the diary as follows:
COL A. TIME BEGAN TIME ENDED Columns D-J = 0


481 00:00 24:00

579


COLUMNS B AND C TIME BEGAN and TIME END


Total Time for activities done on the specified diary day must equal exactly 24 hours . Code the
diary beginning at 0000 (midnight) and ending at 2400, the following midnight, by using a 24hour clock or military time. (The first 2 digits represent the hour in the 24-hour sequence and the
last 2 digits represent the minutes, so 7:23 p.m. is written as 19:23.) Check to see that the "TIME
ENDED" for each activity is the same as the "TIME BEGAN" for the next activity, e.g.:


Drove to the store 12:30 - **12:45**

Shopped for a hammer **12:45**    - 12:55


V5     2


COLUMNS D IF WATCHING TV, was that a video tape or TV program?

Use the Activity Code list (pp. 21-43)


V5     4


RECORDING ACTIVITIES


Generally, primary and secondary activities and times should be coded as the interviewer has
recorded them. An activity listed as a primary will remain a primary activity unless travel is the
concurrent activity (see Travel, page 12). Secondary activities remain as secondary activities
unless:


1. The secondary is traveling.
2. The secondary could not possibly be done while doing the primary activity.

=
3. The secondary is night s sleep.


COMBINING ACTIVITIES


When adjacent primary activities fall into the same code category, code them separately as they
are recorded in the diary; do not group them together except in the case of work activities and
school activities (going to and from classes at school) when Columns F, G, H and J remain the

same.


GAPS


If there are gaps in the time, edit them using the following instructions.


When a gap of 10 minutes or less exists between the time an activity ended and the next activity
began, allocate 1/2 of the time to the activity preceding the gap and 1/2 of the time to the activity
following the gap.


Below are examples of unedited and edited time gaps:


Showered 7:10 - 7:25

Ate breakfast 7:35 - 7:55


7:30

Showered 7:10 - ~~7:25~~

Ate breakfast ~~7:35~~    - 7:55

7:30

If the gap is longer than 10 minutes, edit a "TIME BEGAN" and "TIME ENDED" for this time
period in the space between activities, label the activity NA and code 481. Code the "TIME
BEGAN" and "TIME ENDED" for the NA activity, and code "O" in Columns D through J.


OVERLAPS


When there is an overlap in time periods, calculate the overlap time periods, and divide it equally
between the two activities by subtracting 1/2 the overlapping time from the ending time of the last
activity and adding the other 1/2 of the overlapping time to the beginning time of the second
activity.


V5     5


Below are examples of unedited and edited overlaps in time:


Watched TV 11:00 - 12:00

Eating 11:40 - 12:15


11:50

Watched TV 11:00 - ~~12:00~~

Eating ~~11:40~~    - 12:15
11:50


In this example, there is a 20 minute overlap which is divided equally into two 10 minute time
segments. Ten minutes is then subtracted from the time spent "WATCHING TV" and converted
into clock time. The other 10 minutes is added onto the time spent "EATING" and converted
into clock time.


If a secondary activity is recorded, enter it (as usual) with the primary activity it is associated
with, even though the time will be shortened or lengthened in the same amount as its primary.


ALLOCATING ODD MINUTES


In dividing time for gaps, overlaps, and splitting multiple mentions (which will be covered later),
often an even split of minutes will not be possible. In this case, allocate the extra minute to the
first activity involved.


ACTIVITY BY OTHERS


When R reports an activity done by someone other than her/himself, check the secondary activity
to try and ascertain what R was doing. Cross out what others were doing with a single line and
draw an arrow from R's activity to the primary activity column, assuming the time period is the
same, and Columns D through H remain the same, and there are no secondary activities. If unable
to ascertain R's activity, cross out what the other people were doing with a single line, write in
NA, and code 984 (activities of others reported). Code the "TIME BEGAN" and "TIME
ENDED" for the segment and code "O" in Columns D through J. (See "HELPING",
"WAITING" and "ACCOMPANYING", p.8)


PUBLIC PLACES


In the G/H columns, busdriver/students/classmates all get coded as A K. Other non-relatives of
child. @ If in a public place, store, bus, etc., assume there is other non-relative present. It also gets
coded as A K- other non-relative of child. @


V5     6


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR 408, 409, 411/488


If the child is receiving help from an adult or caregiver, under the G column, it will always be a
488 regardless of age, or if Col A says received help. If R is 3 or under and no one is mentioned in
the G column it will always be coded 488. If no one is mentioned in the G column and R is 4 or
over it will be coded 408, 409, or 411. If this is unclear see supervisor.


V5     7


PRIMARY ACTIVITIES


REPORTING


In all cases where an activity is reported as a primary activity it will remain a primary activity
except where travel has been listed as a secondary activity (see "SECONDARY ACTIVITIES:
TRAVEL", p.6).


MULTIPLE PRIMARIES: SEPARATE CODES


If more than one primary activity is listed for a segment of time, divide the time evenly between
the activities listed, e.g.:


Example A: Prepared and ate dinner 6:00 - 7:00


would look like the following after editing:


Prepared 6:00 - 6:30
Ate dinner 6:30 - 7:00


Example B: Washed up, ate breakfast, read 8:00 - 9:00

paper


would look like the following after editing:


Washed up 8:00 - 8:20
Ate breakfast 8:20 - 8:40

Read paper 8:40 - 9:00


MULTIPLE PRIMARIES: SAME CODE


However, if the multiple primary activities fall into the same activity code category, such as
"making beds, vacuuming, and dusting," do not divide the segment of time, but code as one
primary activity.


COMBINATION


When three or more primary activities are grouped together in one time segment and some fall
into the same code category and some do not, split the time proportionately among all the listed
activities, then divide the activities according to the code categories and their order of mention.


Unedited and edited versions of combinations follow:


V5     8


Example A: Made beds, vacuumed, ate lunch11:00 - 12:30


Made beds, vacuumed 11:00 - 12:00

Ate lunch 12:00 - 12:30


Example B: Made beds, ate lunch, vacuumed11:00 - 12:30


Made beds 11:00 - 11:30

Ate lunch 11:30 - 12:00

Vacuumed 12:00 - 12:30


COMMON SENSE


If in following any of these editing instructions, a clearly nonsensical record would be produced,
see supervisor.


Nonsensical example:


Put on swimsuit and sunbathed 1:00 - 3:30


Following the splitting multiple primary rule, would be:


Put on swimsuit 1:00 - 2:15

Sunbathed 2:15 - 3:30


Clearly, this creates a ridiculous amount of time for the dressing code and should be modified with
the aid of the editing supervisor.


ACTIVITIES TAKING 1 MINUTE OR LESS


If an activity normally takes one minute or less to do and is not allocated a time period of its own
in the diary, cross it out with a single line.


Example: Got in car and rode home 9:00 - 9:15


rode home 9:00 - 9:15


WAITING


Whenever possible, code "waiting for" event to begin/place to open/plane to arrive, etc. as part of
the activity being waited for, so that "waiting for stores to open" while at the mall to shop is
Shopping 302 and waiting for someone's plane to arrive is part picking someone up (helping) at
the airport.


V5     9


SECONDARY ACTIVITIES


REPORTING


A secondary activity is left as a secondary unless:


1. It is travel.

2. It cannot reasonably be done concurrently with the primary activity (e.g.,
primary= watch TV, secondary= mow the lawn).
3. It is night's sleep.


TRAVEL


If the secondary activity is travel from one place to another, move it to the primary column and
the primary activity listed may be moved to the secondary column, or split, depending on the
primary activity.


(NOTE: This is one exception where an activity listed as primary does not always remain
primary.) If travel occurred as a portion of the primary activity, split the primary according to
travel splitting rules.


Example of reversed primary and secondary:


Primary Secondary
Listen to the news Rode to school


Since it appears these are concurrent activities and travel must be the primary, reverse the position
of these to:


Primary Secondary
Rode to school Listen to the news


NON-CONCURRENT


If the secondary activity cannot be done at the same time as the primary activity:


1. Cross it out as secondary.
2. Edit it into Column A beneath the associated primary.
3. Divide the time equally between the primary activities.
4. Code Columns F through J the same.


An example of an unedited and edited non-concurrent activity follows:


V5     10


Column A: What did you do? Column F: Anything else?


Dressed for school 8:00 - 8:45 Did dishes


Dressed for school 8:00 - 8:23

Did dishes 8:23 - 8:45


MULTIPLE SECONDARIES


When there is more than one secondary activity listed for one time segment:


1. Cross out the extra secondary with a single line and edit it into a new/split activity line.
2. Record the same primary activity on this line.
3. Divide the time segment equally.


Column A: What did you do? Column F: Anything else?


Ate dinner 5:00 - 6:00 Talked with brother, read paper


Edited:


Ate dinner 5:00 - 5:30 Talked with brother,
Ate dinner 5:30 - 6:00 Read paper


PRIMARY AND SECONDARY THE SAME ACTIVITY CODE


If the secondary activity uses the same code as the primary activity, cross it out and code no
secondary activity.


If a secondary activity just describes the primary activity in more detail, cross out the secondary
activity, e.g.:


Column A: What did you do? Column F: Anything else?


Visited the neighbors Looked at their flower bed


Would become:

Visited the neighbors


INTERMITTENT SECONDARY ACTIVITY


If a secondary activity is reported as being done "IN AND OUT" of the primary activity (or
"BACK AND FORTH," "PART OF THE TIME") split the primary and code half of the time with
the secondary and half without.


V5     11


NA DIARY


If R has given no activities or 1 or 2 activities for the whole day, NA the diary as follows:


ACTIVITY TIME BEGAN TIME ENDED columns D-J = 0


481 00:00 24:00

579


V5     12


ACTIVITY CODE INSTRUCTIONS


GETTING UP/GOING TO BED


1. The phrases "GOING TO BED" and "GETTING UP" are only coded as activities if the
segment of time is allotted to them, in which case code "407", otherwise cross them out.


Example: Got up 8:00
Went to school 8:00 - 8:15


2. However, if there's a gap in the morning between "GETTING UP" and, for example,
"LEAVING FOR SCHOOL", allot that time period for "GETTING UP", code 407.


HELPING ("helped clean the garage")


Helping other adults in household -- code the task being performed as R's activity.
Helping children in household -- code under child care, 221 or 222.
Helping someone outside household -- code 422, 423 or 424.
Children helping with household tasks -- code the task performed as the child's activity _regardless_

=
_of whether or not the child would make a significant contribution to the activity_ . (The child s age
should indicate the level of the contribution to the analyst.)


Activities are coded as help and care to adults in HH, relatives, neighbors or friends (421, 422,
423, 424) only when helping another seems to be the primary goal of the activity more than the
actual activity (a household chore or leisure, for example) is a joint activity of the respondent and
the individual who appears to be receiving help.


SHOPPING


Beware of where R went shopping. If one segment of time is listed for "WENT SHOPPING" and
multiple places are specified in Column D or elsewhere, divide according to multiple primary
rules. Do not automatically code 302 -- shopping.


WAITING


If the waiting does not fall into Code 997 (waiting in car), then code the waiting in the specific
OTHER category under what they are waiting for (e.g., A WAITING TO EAT @ - code 489). If
what the child is waiting for cannot be determined, code 489 -- waiting for personal care. If a
child is accompanying a parent and does not seemed to be directly involved in the purpose of the
trip, Code 998 (Travel of child with adult) for both the travel and waiting.


"SAT AND ..."


Do not code the sitting, just the other activity (TALKED, READ, etc.).


V5     13


FEEDING CHILDREN AGES 4 AND UNDER


If R says he/she "FED KIDS" and this includes both fixing and serving food to children ages 4 and
under, code 1/2 the time Meal Preparation (108 or 109) and the other 1/2 Baby Care (209).


FEEDING CHILDREN OVER AGE 4 AND UNDER AGE 4


If "FEEDING CHILDREN" over 4 and under 4. split as above.


FEEDING CHILDREN ALL OVER AGE 4


If "FEEDING CHILDREN" all over 4, code Meal Preparation (108-109) only.


TV WATCHING


If the television is on, under the D column, but television is not listed as a primary or secondary
activity, it needs to be split. TV watching (919) becomes a secondary activity. Split it
accordingly, if necessary. The program name will not be entered. If more than one television
program is mentioned and TV watching is the secondary activity (as in this case), do not split for
each program.


CONVENTIONS ON PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES


The following times should be used when activities listed below must be split from other
activities:


Activity Time Assumed



189 Feeding pets
189 Letting pets in or out
409 Dressing/getting ready
449 Eating out
409 "GOING TO THE JOHN"

652 Praying (meal time/bed time)
799 Walking to neighbor's, friend's
or other nearby place



5 minutes

2 minutes

10 minutes

30 minutes

3 minutes

2 minutes

2 minutes



When you need to split activities from
night's sleep as in "WENT TO BED AND ...":
assume reading (939), meditating (652) or
any other activities 30 minutes


These allocations should be used even if splitting the activities produces a smaller amount of time
for the other activity.


V5     14


PAID WORK


If R works or does something for someone, e.g. rake leaves, we will assume it was without pay
unless they specifically say they were paid. These will be coded as 423, 424, etc.


ANIMAL CARE

Beware of distinction between, 189, playing and caring for pets, and 844, care for
animals/livestock. An animal will be considered a pet if it is an animal that commonly comes
inside.


V5     15


TRAVEL


SELECTION OF TRAVEL CODE BY PURPOSE OF TRIP


The travel code is generally associated with the purpose of the trip, both going to and coming
back from. For example, if "DROVE TO THE GROCERY STORE" took 10 minutes and
"DROVE HOME" took another 10 minutes, code each 10 minute segment as travel related to
shopping.


ALWAYS PRIMARY (The nineties--099, 299, etc.--of each heading except HOUSEHOLD)


Travel can never be a secondary activity. When travel is reported as a secondary activity and it is
a non-concurrent activity:


1. Cross it out and move it to the primary column under the primary it was listed
with.

2. Split the time according to NO TRAVEL REPORTED rules, page 16.
3. Edit Column F to "TRANSIT".

4. Assume Columns G and H are the same as for the associated primary unless noted
otherwise.

5. Assume there is no secondary activity.


When travel is reported as secondary activity and it is going on concurrently with the primary
activity:


1. Draw a double pointed arrow from it to the primary activity.
2. Change their places when numbering and coding.


MULTIPLE PURPOSE TRIPS


In the case of a trip that had multiple purposes, e.g.,


Biked to the drugstore
Picked up a prescription
Biked to my friend's house
Visited

Biked home


code each travel segment as travel related to the next primary activity, then code the last segment
of the trip ("BIKED HOME") as travel time related to the last activity ("VISITED").


TRAVEL MODE


Assume travel mode remains the same for all travel when editing multiple trips unless noted
otherwise.


V5     16


TRIP WITHIN A TRIP


If there is a clear trip within a trip, then code travel to and from as you would if R went there and
back from home.


EXAMPLE CODE

Drove to church 699

Drove to store 399

Bought pacifier 302
Drove back to church 399

Went to church 651

Drove home 699


SHOPPING TRAVEL


Code "PICKED UP FRIEND TO GO SHOPPING" as shopping-related travel (399), not visitingrelated travel.


TRANSPORTING OTHERS


In general, code the travel time related to the purpose of the trip, e.g., "TAKING SOMEONE
ELSE TO SCHOOL" (if R is not going to school), code 498--travel related to helping others.


SCHOOL TRAVEL


Travel related to school (codes 597, 598) is to capture only the time R spends commuting to get
to his/her school and to get back home from school (at the end of R's school day). Any
intervening trips are to be coded as travel related to the purpose of the activity (e.g., travel to and
from lunch will be coded as travel related to personal care). Field trips during regular school
hours do not get included as a separate activity. They are included in 509 as an in-class activity.


NO TRAVEL REPORTED, SINGLE TRIP: SHORT ACTIVITY (90 minutes or less)


If travel has not been reported and travel is implied by a change of place, and the activity reported
was 90 minutes or less (allow 1/2 of the total time spent for travel). Split the travel time in half
and show half (1/4 of the activity time) to get to the activity and half (other 1/4 of total activity
time) to get home. An unedited and edited example follows:


Went to grandmother's house 9:30 - 10:30


Travel to grandmother's house 9:30 - 9:45
Visited grandmother 9:45 - 10:15
Travel home 10:15 - 10:30


V5     17


NO TRAVEL REPORTED, SINGLE TRIP: LONG ACTIVITY (over 90 minutes)


If travel has not been reported and travel is implied by a change of place, and the activity was over
90 minutes, assume total travel time was 45 minutes of the activity and edit in 23 minutes travel
there and 22 minutes travel back (unless you have reason to believe otherwise).


TRAVEL REPORTED; ONE WAY
If travel is reported one way, with the same start or end point, code the same amount of time for
the missing trip segment.


ERRANDS
If R says A errands, @ multiple of errands unspecified code 389. Use no travel time reported, single
trip coding rules.


NO TRAVEL REPORTED: ADJACENT ACTIVITIES


When travel is omitted from two (or more) adjacent activities:


1. Take the travel time getting from one activity to the other from the longer activity (of the
two), using appropriate editing instructions for travel not reported.


2. Then, from the shorter activity of the two, take 1/4 of the time for travel and the rest for
the activity.


EXAMPLE:


PRIMARY ACT TIME REPORTED TIME EDITED


To the grocery store 1 hr. 15 min. travel
45 min. shopping


To the laundromat 2 hrs. 23 min. travel

75 min. at laundry
22 min. travel


To the shopping center 1 hr. 45 min. shopping
15 min. travel


EXCEPTION TO NO TRAVEL REPORTED


If travel has not been reported and R went next door, or down the street, or somewhere else close
by, allow two minutes going and two minutes coming back from the time the activity took (unless
activity took less than 5 minutes, then see supervisor).


V5     18


NO TIME SPENT AT PLACE TRAVELED TO


Assume these are very brief "drop off" stops of a minute or less and code as recorded unless
nonsense result is produced. If it is clear that a significant amount of the time mentioned was
spent at an unmentioned activity, use regular splitting rules. If activity is "drove to movies" and
time is 3 hours, assume/split to include attending the movie. If in doubt, see supervisor.


PLEASURE DRIVING


Code "DRIVING AROUND," "OUT FOR A RIDE," etc. as 817. NOTE: 817 is not a
"TRAVEL CODE" in that there is no destination and may be left as a secondary activity.


V5     19


GUIDELINES FOR CODING CHILD DIARIES


SECONDARY ACTIVITIES--DON'T KNOW


If "DON'T KNOW" is written in Column H, secondary activity column, treat as if there were no
secondary activity (000).


HELPING OR ACCOMPANYING ACTIVITIES


When the diary child is helping someone else do something, the activity he/she is helping with
should be coded. However, in the case where a child reports helping another child with what is a
"play" activity, code the appropriate "playing" code (871-877) unless there is an indication that
child care was taking place (such as an age difference as well as activity description of helping), in
which case you should see your supervisor. When a child is accompanying a parent and does not
seemed to be directly involved in the purpose of the trip, Code 998 (Travel of child with adult) for
both the travel and waiting.


PLAYING


Playing needs to be very carefully coded by the type of interactions the child is having. Most of
the playing categories are together under the category of playing on page 31. But other activities
which are considered play may more accurately be coded by the action, rather than with one of
the general playing categories. For instance, playing a "pick up game" of baseball would be 801,
doing yoga would be coded 808, official team games or practice would be 883, tennis lessons
would be 885, and hiking would be 822.


Identifying social games or interactions with others (873) may not be immediately obvious. An
activity is not a social game just because it is a game where others are doing the activity with the
child. Instead, the question is the nature of the playing which is taking place. For instance,
playing tag would be a social game but running (823) or catch (807) would not. While playing
tag, a primary component of the activity is interacting with each other. With running or catch, the
purpose is more likely developing physical ability rather the human relationship. Jumping rope or
doing hand clap or string games is also interactive and a primary component of the activity in a
way that is not true for singing (862).


If no descriptive information is available other than the word "play" or "playing," then code the
activity as unspecified playing (877).


PLAYING WITH BABIES


"Playing with babies" code 248 (household babies, age 0-2) or 278 (non-household babies, age 02). However, these are childcare codes and should only be used when the child whose activities
are being coded is an older child. If the child whose activities are being coded is young (under 6),
these activities should be coded as social playing or playing where others were present.


V5     20


SCHOOL


Assume household children who attend school are "full-time" students where you must distinguish
among categories on this basis.


SCHOOL TRAVEL


Travel to and from school by children can be coded one of the following three ways:


1) If the child travels directly from his/her home to school without stops or interruptions,
code 597.


2) If the child travels directly from school to home without any stops or interruptions, code
598.


3) If the child travels to school from someplace other than home (e.g., from the babysitter's),
code 599. Travel from school to a destination other than home (e.g., a friend's house, or
the drug store) should be coded as travel to that destination (e.g., 399 would describe
travel to the drug store after school). If it seems awkward to code travel from school to a
destination other than home (for instance, if the stop can't really be described as a
destination), check with a supervisor.


OTHER 599 CODES


599=to the bus stop.
599=bus stop to school
599=daycare to school
599=school to daycare
