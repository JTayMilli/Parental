**Forward to the 1997 Child Development Supplement Project**


**Welcome to the Child Development Supplement Project. This study will collect information from**
**families with children under age 13 who complete the 1997 Panel Study of Income Dynamics**
**(PSID) interview.**


**Development Supplement is called a "supplement" because it utilizes the thirty years of data**
**available from the PSID families to enhance its study objectives. At the same time, it stands on**
**its own as a complete project which will obtain some of the most comprehensive information**
**available about children.**


**Field Interviewers for this study will use general interviewing skills to conduct face-to-face**
**interviews with children and their primary caregivers. Additionaly, Interviewers will learn to**
**administer educational assessments that accompany the face-to-face interview and to gather**
**information using time diaries. Interviewers will distribute self administered (mailed or delivered)**
**questionnaires. If a child's biological father lives in another household, Interviewers will also**
**conduct a phone interview with that parent.**


**Most of the interviewing time during a visit to a family will be spent with the adults. But one of**
**the unique aspects of this study is that Interviewers conduct educational assessments and**
**implement a short interview with up to two children in the household. Interviewers who**
**participated in the pretests for the project reported that they enjoyed the child interviews.**

**the parents, teachers, and from the children themselves. We expect over**
**3,000 families to participate. The objective is to provide researchers with**

**families that can be analyzed to study the effects that maternal employment**
**patterns, family structure changes, and poverty have on child health and**
**development. The project will gather data to study how time, money and**

**cognitive and behavioral development of children as they progress through**
**the stages of early and middle childhood.**


**This newly funded project will fill a gap in research on children by**
**supplementing PSID data that have been collected about a sample of**
**families for the past 29 years. Although titled the PSID Child**
**Development Supplement, it isn't really a supplement in the way we**
**usually think of a few questions added to an existing survey. Instead, it is**
**a separate project that is attached to the PSID by virtue of the fact that we**
**are using the PSID sample.**



**Background on**

**P** **S** **ID**


**Who Are The**

**Respondents?**



**Now in its thirtieth year of data collection, the Panel Study of Income**
**Dynamics is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of U.S. men,**
**women, children and the families in which they reside. Data on**
**employment, income, wealth, housing, fod expenditures, income transfers,**
**marriage and children have been collected annually since 1968. From**
**5,000 families in 1968, the study has grown to include over 10,000**
**families, including more than 2000 families of Cuban, Puerto Rican, and**
**Mexican descent interviewed between 1990 and 1995. Core funding is**
**provided by the National Science Foundation, with additional funding from**
**the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute on**
**Aging, and the National Institute of Child Health and Human**
**Development. The data are used by over 1,100 researchers, journalists, and**
**policy makers throughout the United States and Europe. Since 1968 over**
**600 journal articles, 250 books and book chapters, and 3 50 government**
**reports, working papers, and dissertations have been based upon the PSID.**


**The respondents to the Child Development Supplement will have already**
**been included in at least one PSID interview. The majority of respondents**
**will be from long-time PSID respondent families. Eligibility for the Child**
**Development Supplement is based on the ages of the PSID family's**
**children. If the family has a child age twelve or younger, the entire PSID**
**Household Unit is eligible for the Child Development Supplement.**


**Adult respondents include selected persons who have influence over the**
**child's development. The following is a list of potential respondents in a**
**household case. A household case would never include every respondent**
**on this list. A face-to-face interview will be administered only to the**
**children and primary caregiver.**


**The Child: Up to two children age twelve and younger per Family Unit**
**are eligible for inclusion in this study. Al eligible children must be**


**SECTION ONE - INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY** 5


**members of the PSI** **D** **Sample. Therefore, it is possible to have some**
**children in a household who are not eligible for inclusion in this study. If**
**the child is under 3 years of age, although still eligible for the study, the**
**child is not interviewed and information will be gathered on this child from**
**other sources.**


**Primary Caregier;v** **The Primary Caregiver is the main respondent for**
**this study and will usually be the child• s mother. If the mother is not**
**living with the child, the primary caregiver could be the father, legal**
**guardian or person who knows most about the child's activities. If the**
**primary caregiver is being interviewed about two children, the**
**Interviewer will fill out a separate questionnaire for each child. The**
**primary caregiver will also complete time diaries for the child and a self­**
**administered household booklet.**


**Other Possible Rspondents:**
**e**


**Other Caregiver: The Other Caregiver is another adult in the household**
**(usually the child's father, or the mother's spouse/partner) who helps raise**
**the child. This respondent will complete self administered questionnaires.**


**Father Outside of the Home: In families where the biological father of**
**the child(ren) is not living in this household, Interviewers will contact him**
**and conduct an interview by telephone.**


**Teacher or Child Care Provider: Interviewers will send a self­**
**administered questionnaire to the child's teacher or child care provider. A**
**time diary for the child is included in these questionnaires. For children in**
**home school, the parent or household member who teaches the child is**
**given a teacher questionnaire to fill out.**


**School or Child Care Administrator: Interviewers also send a self­**
**administered questionnaire to the administrator of the school or child care**
**center that the child attends. The administrator questionnaire asks about**
**the school or program environment.**


**Interviewer: The interviewer is also a respondent in this study. The**
**interviewer reports on observations about the respondents and their**
**interactions. These observations are recorded in thumbnail sketches and**
**additional questions at the back of the interviewer administered**
**questionnaires.**

This section is designed to orient the field interviewer to the process
involved in the Child Development Supplement. The large number of
components in this study makes it important to pay attention to the details
of setting up, administering, and completing the interviews. Below is a list
of procedures used in processing a household case and the preferred order
of administration. We understand that not a
**l** interviews can be completed
in this order, however, we have found that in general the interviews go
more smoothly when this order can be followed.


A household case will appear in your CSMS to alert you that you will soon
be receiving your household packet from Ann Arbor. When you receive
your packet, you can review it to get the profile of the household. You
should receive the following:


a household information sheet listing HU members

- a CSMS checklist

- a household labeled coversheet

a father outside of the home coversheet (when applicable).

a sheet oflabels for each child


This step involves actually setting up the materials for the household. Your
bulk materials will include the questionnaires and materials you will need to
complete your household cases. You must determine what materials this
household will need and organize them. This includes putting labels in the
proper places on each questionnaire. You may not know where some
labels, such as the school labels, should go yet. Keep those labels with the
household accordion file so that, as the process continues, you can
complete the labeling.


Once you have assembled the household packet, you are ready to contact
the household. You will talk to the primary caregiver, give the details of
what the interview will involve and set up an appointment time for an in­
person interview. The P SID respondent will have been told that they are
eligible for this study but it is possible that the primary caregiver may not
know about the study. It is important to fully explain what will be
expected of the household. Explain the time diaries and how they work
After talking to the primary caregiver, send the household introduction
packet which will include a study brochure, introduction letter, and time
diaries.

**SECTION ONE - INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY** **7**


**Before starting the interviews, you need to get a permission fonn signed by**
**the primary caregiver for each selected child. While at the household, you**
**will interview each selected child 3 or older, and interview the primary**
**caregiver about each child aged 0-12. The primary caregiver will also be**
**asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire, and the other**
**caregiver (if there is one) will be given a self-administered questionnaire for**
**the household and one for each child. Before leaving the household, you**
**will review the time diaries with the primary caregiver and obtain the**
**primary caregiver' s signature on any teacher permission fonns that may be**
**needed.**


**As soon as possible after a household visit, edit all the interviews and time**
**diaries completed, and enter the CSMS information.**


**If either or both of the children are in school, preschool, or child care,**
**you will send a questionnaire packet to the proper teacher or child care**
**provider. A packet also needs to be sent to school or child care center**
**administrators. The contents of these packets will be detailed later in this**
**manual. The date the packets are mailed and address infonnation should**
**be entered into CSMS.**


**If there is a father living outside of the target child's home and the primary**
**caregiver gives you his name and address, you will mail the father outside**
**of the home introduction packet. Allow 3-5 days for the father to receive**
**his packet before contacting him by phone. The father outside the home**
**interview includes a questionnaire for each sample child, and one**
**questionnaire for household questions. When the interview is completed,**
**edit the questionnaires and record the status code and other infonnation**
**into CSMS.**


**Once all of the components of the entire Child Development Supplement**
**household case have been completed, double-check them for completeness**
**and report to your Team Leader. (He/She) will instruct you where to mail**
**it Check the infonnation in CSMS and make sure the call records are**
**complete before entering the final status code.**

**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **13**


One coversheet will be prepared for each household with sample label
information in this box. The label contains information from the 1997
PSID interview: the name of the Head, (his/her) address, and telephone
number. The ID of the PSID interviewer, as well as the interviewer initially
assigned the Child case, will also appear on the label.


The sample ID for all eligible children in the household will appear on this
label.


For households with 2 primary caregivers, you will need to use a blank
coversheet (from your bulk materials) and write in the sample ID, name of
the primary caregiver, and the name of the child associated with the
primary caregiver. Also, cross out the Sample ID of the child not
associated with the primary caregiver on the labeled coversheet to make it
clear which child belongs with each coversheet. This will not happen very
often, since most households with two sample children will have the same
primary caregiver and only one coversheet will be needed.



Place your interviewer label here.


Use this space to enter address update information that you may discover
when verifying R's mailing address to mail the household introduction
packet.


This is a household case number which you will assign sequentially based
on the number of households you have completed. Each time you
complete household case (a set of household interviews for the child,
primary caregiver, other caregiver, time diaries, and father outside the
home, if there is one), you will assign that "bundle" of interviews a
household case number. The first "bundle" will be Iw No. 1; the second
"bundle" Iw No. 2; and so on. This Iw No. will be used by your team
leader for evaluation purposes. Your TL will tell you which Interview
Numbers should be mailed to (him/her) for verification and evaluation.

Enter the date you finalized the household line for this case (when you
entered an **"01"**
for the CSMS line).


Enter the final result code for this case (usually **"01"** if you have completed
all the questionnaire pieces for the household; or an "OS" if one or more
questionnaire pieces are refused).


Mark the appropriate box to tell us whether or not you paid the respondent
in cash (remember to get a receipt if you did!). This is what we will use to
decide whether or not to send a check to R, so please be sure to mark this
box correctly. We do not want to have any respondent go without
payment (and we also don't want to pay Rs twice).


For every questionnaire that you administer (including time diaries), please
record the interview length here. For the time diaries, the interview length
is the time you spend with R collecting or reviewing the time diary
information. If the time diary is administered in person or on the phone,
the interview length is the time spent collecting the time diary information.
If the time diary has been filled out by the respondent and the interviewer
reviews the time diary with R in the home, the interview length is the time
spent with R doing the review.


For the other questionnaires, the iw length is the elapsed time spent asking
the questions in the booklet. (If there are long pauses in the interview e.g., 10 minutes for the primary caregiver to take care of the children),
mark that in the margins and do not count that time as part of the iw
length. If there is only one child in the household, leave the "Child **#2"**
columns blank.

For the time diary, the edit length is the same - the amount of time you
spend looking over the diary after you have asked the questions or
reviewed the information with R If there is only one child for the
household, leave the "Child **#2"** column blank.

**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEET$ AND CSMS**


**Determine Probable** **Item RI**
**Primary Caregiver** For most households, you will be able to make a good guess at who the
primary caregiver will be based on the information on the Household
Information Sheet. Mark who you think the primary caregiver will be on
the Household Information Sheet and use that as a beginning point when
you contact the household.


The criteria listed here are in priority order. That is, if the child's mother is
living in the household, she will be the primary caregiver. If the mother is
not in the household, the father is the primary caregiver, and so on.


Note that the primary caregiver should never be a person who is paid to
take care of the child, such as a live in babysitter or nanny.


See Appendix B for a detailed definition of each type of respondent.


**Determine Probable** **Item** **2**
**Other Caregiver** This is the same as Item 1 above. If possible, make an educated guess as to
who the other caregiver will be based on the contents of the Household
Information Sheet.


The criteria are listed in priority order.

**Item3**
This is a suggested phone introduction. You are not required to read it
verbatim. We strongly encourage a **l** interviewers to tailor their
introduction using the information provided during training and in this
reference manual. Use the information given in the Study Fact Brochure
and "Questions Commonly Asked by Respondents and Interviewers" to
formulate an introduction with which you are comfortable and successful.


If possible, you should ask to speak with the person you think will be the
primary caregiver. For some large households with many extended family
members, it may not be possible to tell from the Household Information
Sheet who the primary caregiver will be. In that case, explain the study to
any adult that answers the phone and use the following questions in the
coversheet to determine who the primary caregiver will be.


I am calling about the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that

(DAYS/WEEKS) ago. The purpose of this study is to help researchers gain a better understanding of
child development and what types of things help children succeed in school.

**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **1 7**


**Identify Children** **Item** **4- 8**
& **Primary Caregiver** We want the primary caregiver (or informant) to know from the beginning
which children in the household have been chosen for the study.


The questions in items 5 - 8 are designed to take you through the priority
definitions of the primary caregiver, to choose the correct person in the
household to be the primary caregiver. You have some leeway in the
administration of these questions - for example, if there is no female adult
listed in the Household Information Sheet, the questions about "mother"
do not make any sense. If you have questions about how to handle a
particular household situation, contact your Team Leader.


**'**



**Child's Mother**


**'**


**Child's Father**


**Child's Legal**

**Guardian**



**Items 5-5c**
This set of questions asks about the child's mother (biological, step, foster
or adoptive) - the first priority choice for primary caregiver. When reading
items S or Sa, choose the appropriate phrases, or read the options
separated by "or **'** from the parentheses.


If you are speaking with the child's mother, she is the primary caregiver
and you are routed to item 9, which verifies the choice of other caregiver
for the household. After you have verified the choice of primary caregiver,
check the marking on the Household Information sheet and correct it if
necessary. The "ask if necessary" question should be read if it appears that
the informant is a mother-figure for the children (e.g., a PSID "Wife") but
is not a biological, step, foster, or adoptive mother.


For households with no adult females, you do not need to ask questions 5Sc and can go directly to item 6. For households that have an adult female
that does not appear on the Household Information Sheet to be the
child(ren)'s mother, ask item Sa rather than 5, to verify that the mother
does not live in the household.


**Items 6-6c**
If the child(ren)'s mother does not live in the household, you are prompted
to ask for the child(ren)'s father. Choose the appropriate phrases, or read
the options separated by "or" from the parentheses. After you have
verified the choice of primary caregiver, check the marking on the
Household Information sheet and correct it if necessary.


**Items 7-7c**
If the child(ren)'s mother and father are absent from the household, you are
prompted to ask for the child(ren)'s legal guardian. After you have verified
the choice of primary caregiver, check the marking on the Household
Information sheet and correct it if necessary.

**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **19**


**Items 8-8a**
If the child(ren) do(es) not live with mother, father, or legal guardian, you
are prompted to ask for the person in the household who has primary
responsibility for taking care of the child(ren). The other adult can be
related or a non-relative. Probe to make sure that this is not a paid
caregiver, such as a live-in babysitter or na **n** y. After you have verified the
choice of primary caregiver, check the marking on the Household
Information sheet and correct it if necessary.


**Item 9**
If there are no other adults in the household, there cannot be another
caregiver, so you will be routed past the other caregiver verification
questions. If the primary caregiver has been verified as the child(ren)'s
father, you will ask about the child(ren)'s grandmother, who is the second
priority for other caregiver after father.


**Items 10-15**
The questions in this series are designed to take you through the priority
definitions of the other caregiver, to choose the correct person in the
household to be the other caregiver. You have some leeway in the
administration of these questions - for example, if there is no male adult
listed in the Household Information Sheet, the questions about "father" do
not make any sense. Use common sense in administering these questions,
but stick to the script wherever possible. And above all, be sure you are
choosing the correct person as the other caregiver. If you have questions
about how to handle a particular household situation, contact your Team
Leader.


**Items 11-lla**
Choose the appropriate phrases, or read the options separated by "or" from
the parentheses. After you have verified the choice of other caregiver,
check the marking on the Household Information sheet and correct it if
necessary.


The "ask if necessary" question at Item 11 should be read if it appears that
the informant is a father-figure for the children (e.g., living with but not
married to the child(ren)'s mother in a long term, stable relationship) but is
not a biological, step, foster, or adoptive father.



**n**


**Child's Grandmother** **Items 13-13a**
These questions do not need to be asked if the only adult female living in
the household is the primary caregiver. If you verify the grandmother as
the other caregiver, check the marking on the Household Information sheet
and correct it if necessary.

17. TELL RESPONDENT ABOUT PAYMENT OF $25 PER HOUSEHOLD


I would like to set up a time to come to your household and interview you and [CHILD(REN)] (and
OTHER CAREGIVER). You will be mailed a check for $25 after the interview is completed.


18. EXPLAIN TIME DIARY


One of the things we will be asking about is how children spend their time. To do this, we will be
asking you (and CHILD[REN]) to tell us about [CHILD(REN)'S] activities for two days. I would like
to mail two diaries to you and have you record [CHILD(REN)'S] activities on next (WEEKEND
DAY) and next (WEEKDAY). This will make the interview go a bit faster when I come, and will help
us get the best possible information for our study.


19. VERIFY ADDRESS TO MAIL PACKET


I would like to mail an introductory packet to your home which explains a bit more about the study, and
has the time diary for you to fill out. Let me verify that I have the correct mailing address. [CORRECT
ADDRESS ON SPACE BELOW SAMPLE LABEL IF NECESSARY.]

**Boyfriend or**

**GirHriend**


**Other Relative**


**Other Nonrelative**


**Incentive Payment**



**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **21**


**Items l 4-l 4a**
The term "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" are defined as in PSID, meaning that
they have not been living together for a year. If you verify the boyfriend or
girlfriend of the primary caregiver as the other caregiver, check the
marking on the Household Information sheet and correct it if necessary.


**Items 15-15a**
An other relative is defined as an adult who is related to the child(ren) but
not the father or grandmother. It can be R's aunt, uncle, grandfather, etc.
If there is more than one other relative in the household that take care of
the child(ren), probe to find out which one has the most responsibility for
caring for the child(ren).


If you verify an other relative as the other caregiver, check the marking on
the Household Information sheet and correct it if necessary.


**Items 16-16a**
If there is more than one non-related adult in the household that take care
of the child(ren), probe to find out which one has the most responsibility
for caring for the child(ren). If you verify a non-relative as the other
caregiver, check the marking on the Household Information sheet and
correct it if necessary.


Probe to make sure that this is not a paid caregiver, such as a live-in
babysitter or nanny.


**Item 17**
After you have verified who the primary caregiver and other caregiver are,
you will begin the process of explaining the study and setting up the
interview. We have found that it is usually most effective to mention the
incentive payment at this time, but it is acceptable to mention the payment
earlier in the introduction if the respondent is expressing reluctance and
you feel payment would make them more willing to continue.


**22** **SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS**


**e**



**Time Diary**


**e**


**Verify Address**



**Item 18**
Since the time diary is a very important part of this study, it is essential that
you introduce the di ary in a way that encourages the primary caregiver to
fill the diaries out completely and carefully. Use this script as a guide, and
come up with an explanation that you f **e** l comfortable with and that
motivates your respondents to do as good a job as possible with the diaries.


**Item 19**
Since the address on the sample label was updated at the time of the 1997
PSID interview, it should be accurate for the majority of the respondents.
Please verify it to be sure, since time is limited and we don't want to have
any household introduction packets returned because of insufficient or
incorrect address information.


If the address information is not correct, write the correct information on
the space provided under the interviewer label on the front of the
coversheet.

**Item 20**
**There are several things to keep in mind when setting up the appointment.**


**•**
**The appointment time must be within three days of the weekday diary**
**day. That means if the diary day is Thursday, the appointment must**
**be made on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.**

**•** **Try to set an appointment time when the primary caregiver and (both)**
**child(ren) will be home so you can do the interview in one visit if**
**possible.**

**•** **Tell the respondent about how long the interview will take, to make**
**sure that you have sufficient time to do at least one entire**
**questionnaire booklet in a visit.**

**•**
**Make sure the respondent understands that you will be interviewing**
**both (him/her) .and the child(ren).**


**Item 21**
**If there are two children in a household and each child has a different**
**primary caregiver, you will need to fill out a second (unlabeled) coversheet**
**for the second primary caregiver. After you have set up the appointment**
**with the first primary caregiver, ask to speak with the second primary**
**caregiver and work through the coversheet to verify that (he/she) is the**
**appropriate primary caregiver, determine who the other caregiver is for**
**that child, and set an appointment for that child/caregiver pair. Note that it**
**is possible for 2 different children to have 2 different primary caregivers**
**and the same Qtma: caregiver.**


**Item 22**
**After you have set up the appointment, mail the household introduction**
**packet to R. Note the date the packet was mailed on the coversheet.**



**Parental Permission** **Item 23**
**When you visit the household, the first thing you will do is obtain parental**
**permission to interview the child(ren). Ask the primary caregiver to sign**
**the permission form, explaining the study and answering any questions**
**(he/she) may have. Only children 3 years and older need a permission form**
**signed, since you will not be interviewing 0-2 year olds.**


**If the primary caregiver signs the permission form, conduct the interview**
**and assessments with the chid(ren). If the primary caregiver does not give**
**permission to interview the child(ren), we still want to do the primary**
**caregiver and other caregiver interviews (both child and household**
**questionnaires) if at all possible.**


AFTER TIME DIARIES AND INTERVIEWS FOR CHILD AND PRIMARY CAREGIVER ARE
COMPLETED AND SAQ'S ARE LEFT FOR OTHER CAREGIVER, GO TO Rl.


Rl. Thank you very much for this interview. We value people like you who are willing to contribute their
experiences to our research. We will be sending you a check for $25.00 as a way of expressing our
appreciation for your cooperation. My supervisor may be calling or writing to verify this interview.
For these reasons, I would like to verify your name and ask you for your mailing address and telephone

**Address Information** **Rl-R4**
Even though we have a wealth oflocation information from PSID, we still
need to verify the name, address, and obtain contact person information for
the primary caregiver. The primary caregiver will often be a different
person from the PSID "Head" respondent, and ifwe get funding to do this
study again we will need to have information about how to contact the
primary caregiver if (he/she) is no longer living with the PSID respondent.


Please verify the spelling of the respondent's name and address

Contact person information is extremely valuable to us in tracking "lost"
respondents. The contact person should be someone who does not live
with R, but who would know how to get in touch with R. Again, neatness
counts. A name or address that can't be read doesn't do us any good.

**Teacher Information** **R6**
You have obtained this information in the yellow Primary Caregiver-Child
questionnaire, but it is buried in several places throughout the
questionnaire. The easiest thing for us to do was have you ask or verify
the information again here, since you will need to know which teacher and
administrator booklets to mail out after the household interview is
competed.


Note that "a. School (including kindergarten, elementary or secondary
school)" is a priority code - all children in school should have "a. School"
marked.


RS. To get the most complete information possible for our research, we would like to contact your
child(ren)'s (teacher/caregiver) to ask questions about how (he/she/they) spend(s) (his/her/their) day
at (school/preschool/child care). We will be asking general questions about the types of things offered
at your child(ren)'s (school/preschool/child care), as well as asking about how your child(ren) (is/are)

**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **31**


**Teacher Pennission** **R8-R9**
Use the text in the coversheet to develop an explanation of the teacher
permission fonn that you f **e** l comfortable with and that convinces
respondents to sign the permission fonn. We are looking for a high
response rate on this part of the study, since the school and child care
infonnation is very important to understanding child development.


**Home School** **RIO**

For the few respondents who have children in home school ( either in their
own home or in a cooperative setting with other parents), we will ask the
parent (or main teacher) to fill out a teacher questionnaire. If you have a
family with a home schooled child, leave a teacher questionnaire with the
respondent along with a return envelope, and ask (him/her) to fill it out and
mail it to Ann Arbor.

**Persuasion**


**Father Outside**

**Rll**
Because the teacher infonnation is important to us, we want to try gentle
persuasion if the primary caregiver is reluctant to sign the teacher
permission fonn. Be sure the respondent understands that the infonnation
will be kept confidential, and we will use the data for research purposes
only. Do not do any hard-core refusal conversion, since we expect most
respondents to be willing to sign the fonn without any hesitation.


**R12**
This checkpoint refers you back to the yellow Primary Caregiver-Child
questionnaire to see if the child has a father who is not living in the
household.


(USE EXTRA PAGE IF MORE THAN ONE FATHER OUTSIDE THE HOME)


R13. We would also like to contact [CffiLD(REN)'S] father to learn more about families with children
whose parents do not live together. For research purposes, the information we gather will be more
complete ifwe talk with parents with whom the child lives, arui with the other parent. For this
reason, we would like to ask you some questions about [ClilLD(REN)'S] father.

**R13-R18**
This is a unique part of the study, in that very few child studies get
information from both parents when the parents are divorced or not living
together. We want to get as high a response rate as possible for this part
of the study, but we know that some mothers will be unable or unwilling to
tell us where the child(ren)'s father is.


If the primary caregiver is unwilling to tell us where the father is, assure her
that we will keep her address and phone number confidential, and we will
not release any information from this interview to him. If the primary
caregiver simply has no idea where the father is, get his last known address
and a contact person who might know how to get in touch with him.


Please write legibly, and ask for the correct spelling of his name and
address information.


A few households will have two children with different fathers living
outside the home. If you find a situation like this, use the extra sheets from
your bulk materials to collect contact information about the second father.
Be sure to mark on the extra sheet which father information goes with
which child.


Rl9. Thank you. These are all the questions I have. In appreciation for your participation, we will mail
you a check for $25.00.

1.
Hello, my name is [FULL NAME] from the University of Michigan Survey Research
Center. May I speak with (NAME OF R)? We are currently working on a study of
children and families. This is a supplement to the annual Panel Study of Income Dynamics
for which you may have been interviewed in the past. The purpose of this study is to help
researchers gain a better understanding of child development and what types of things help
children be successful in life.


2.
An important part of our research is to learn more about families with children whose
parents do not live together. For that reason, we would like to interview you about

[CHILD(REN)]. A **l** information we gather will be kept completely confidential. You will
receive $20 for this interview.


3. USE INFORMATION ON GREY HOUSEHOLD COVERSH **E** T (ITEMS Rl3-Rl8)
TO VERIFY THAT YOU HA VE CORRECT RESPONDENT, AND TO TRACK
RESPONDENT IF NECESSARY.


4.
GO TO CHILD INTERVIEW(S) FIRST, THEN HOUSEHOLD INTERVIEW.


**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **3 9**


**PART B: FATHER OUTSIDE THE HOME COVERSHEET**


**Sample Label** One coversheet will be prepared for each child with a father living outside
the child's household. We will know from the PSID interview which
children are not living with their fathers, but will not know if two-child
households have the same father, or two different fathers living outside the
home.


For this reason, we will prepare one label for each child who has a father
not living with them, and you will find out on the primary caregiver
coversheet (R13-R18) if this is one or two fathers. The label contains
sample information :from the 1997 PSID interview: the name of the child,
and sample ID.


Below the sample label is a space to write in the father's name and
telephone number :from the grey Household coversheet.


**Interviewer's Label** Place your interviewer label here.


**Date of Final Result** Enter the date you finalized this case (when you entered an "01" for the
CSMS line).


**Final Status Code** Enter the final status code for this case (usually "01 [11 ] if you have completed
all the questionnaire pieces for the father; or an "05" if one questionnaire
piece is missing).


Rl.
Thank you very much for this interview. We value people like you who are willing to
contribute their experiences to our research. We will be sending you a check for $20. 00 as
a way of expressing our appreciation for your cooperation. My supervisor may be writing
or calling to verify this interview. For these reasons, I would like to verify your name and
ask you for your mailing address.

For every questionnaire that you administer, please record the interview
length here.


The interview length is the elapsed time spent asking the questions in the
booklet. (If there are long pauses in the interview - e.g., 10 minutes for the
father to take another call), mark that in the margins and do not count that
time as part of the iw length.


If there is only one child for the father, leave the "Child #2" column blank.


The edit length is the amount of time you spend editing the questionnaire
after ~~the~~ in ~~tere~~ vi w i ~~s co~~ m ~~p~~ l ~~eed~~ t . This includes time spent answering
interviewer observation questions, writing thumbnail sketches, and
checking for legibility of answers.


If there is only one child for the father, leave the "Child #2" column blank.


**Items** **1-2**
As with the other introductions, this is a suggested script only. Use this as
a guide to come up with an introduction with which you f **e** l comfortable
and that works to convince fathers to do the interview.


**Item 3**
Use the information obtained from the primary caregiver to track the
respondent. Due to budgetary constraints, we will limit our tracking to
directory assistance calling for the respondent and contact person.


**4**
**Item**
Note that you should administer the child interview(s) first, since the
information in the child questionnaires is used in interviewer checkpoints in
the household questionnaires.

**Most of the items on this sheet are self explanatory, but a few of the items**
**are described here.**


**Selected Children**
**The children to be included in the Child Development Supplement will be**
**listed here.** If **there is only one eligible child in the household, just that**
**child's name will appear in the "Selected Children" rows. It is possible that**
**there will be children aged 0-12 not eligible, who will be listed in the "Rest**
**of** **rows.**
HU"


**Relationship to Head**
**This wil** be **the relationship to the PSID Head that was obtained in the**
**Core interview.**


**Sample ID**
**This is the Child Development Sample ID.**


**Child Seq#**
**This is the Surveycra:ft sequence number of the child.** **It** **is used to**
**identify each person in the household listing, and is part of the Sample**
**ID.**


**Dad Out?**
**There will** be **a "Y"** **(if** **the child has a father living outside the home) or**
**"N"** **(if** **the child does not have a father living outside the home) in this**
**column, based on Core interview information.**


**Mthr Seq#**
If **we know from the Core interview that the child is living with**
**(his/her) biological mother, the mother's Surveycra:ft Sequence Number**
**will be listed here. She will be the primary caregiver.**


**Fthr Seq#**
If **we know from the Core interview that the child is living with**
**(his/her) biological father, the father's Surveycra:ft Sequence Number**
**will** be **listed here. He will usually be the other caregiver** **(if** **the mother**
**is living with the family), or in some cases will be the primary caregiver**
**(Refer to the Coversheet or Appendix B for definitions.)**

**Rest of HU**
The other members of the HU will be listed here. These are the people
from which you will choose a primary caregiver for each child and an other
caregiver (if applicable).

This is the Surveycraft sequence number of each of the other persons in
the HU.


**FU Member?**
This will be marked "Y' if the person is a member of the PSID Family
Unit.


**Primary Caregiver**
Please put a check in this column to indicate which person in the HU is
the primary caregiver.


**Other Caregiver**
Please put a check in this column to indicate which person in the HU is
the other caregiver. If there is no other caregiver in the household,
leave the column blank.


**Core Family Interview Thumbnail Sketches**
The thumbnail sketches from the Core interview will be printed here, for
your reference. We have asked Core interviewers to note in the thumbnail
sketches any potential problems or other things the Child interviewer will
need to know about the family.



**Changes in HH**
**Composition**



The household listing taken at the Core interview is the household listing
we will work with for the Child interview. If someone has moved in or
out, we will not use that information for this study. That means that the
primary caregiver, other caregiver, and sample children must all be listed
on the Household Information Sheet.


If someone has moved into the household, we will treat them as if they are
not part of the household for the purposes of this interview.


If the primary caregiver, other caregiver, or a sample child has moved out
of the household between the PSID and Child interviews, those pieces will
be coded "noninterviews"

**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **4 5**


**PARTC: CSMS**


**What CSMS looks**
CSMS stands for CAJ Sample Management System. It is a computer
**Like and why** program designed to help you manage your sample. The Child
Development Supplement has many different forms and booklets to track.
Each of these pieces has its own place on CSMS. As you work each
aspect of a child case, you will be making entries both on the main CSMS
Browse Screen and in the Ca **l** Record Display.


**Lines per Household** There will be either two or three lines for each Child case. A household
line and a school line will be generated for every child. There will only be a
third line ifthere is a father outside the home (DadOut), based on the
information pulled from the PSID interview. Ifthere are two selected
**each** child.
children in one household, these lines will be generated for
This means that there can be up to six sample lines in CSMS for one
household case.


**Sample ID** The Sample ID numbers for the different lines have specific meanings. The
first four (4) digits are the PSID Main Family numbers. The next three (3)
are the specific family unit identifier. For New Sample cases this will
always be 911. The next two (2) digits reflect the PSID Sequence number
of the specific child related to that line. The final digit indicates whether
that line is for the Child (-1 ), School (-2), or Dad Out (-3).


**Columns** There are more columns than can be shown on one screen. You will be
using your cursor (arrow) keys to move back and forth across the fields.
Some of the fields will contain an "X" to indicate that the field is not
applicable on that line. These Xs should **not** be changed by the
interviewer.


**Value Codes**
Unlike other studies, for the Child Development Supplement you will be
making entries directly on the Main CSMS Browse screen. These entries
are called Value Codes. To see these Value Codes, type "9" when you are
in any of the entry fields. A Value Code should be entered every time you
have any activity involving either the Child line or the Dad Out line.
(Entries are not made on the Main Browse screen for School lines - all
these fields are filled with Xs.)


These Value codes allow you, your RFM and TL, the Control Office, and
Study Staff to see the current status of every piece of the Child


**46** **SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS**


Development Supplement. It is imperative that you enter Value Codes and
transmit on a daily basis.


**Value Codes:**

: No Data **=**
Nothing has been attempted for this Instrument
I : Cmp:Mailed = Completed Case mailed to AA, RFM or TL
2 : Cmp:Held = Completed but not yet mailed to AA, RFM or TL
3 : Left = Questionnaire (SAQ) left with Respondent
4 : Ref= Refusal to complete particular Instrument
5 : Appt **=** Specific appointment to complete that Instrument
6 : Mail = Questionnaire mailed to Respondent
7 : INAP = Inap, No questionnaire for this line (e.g., no other caregiver)
X : NA **=**
(Entered by Control Office) Not Applicable in any circumstance



**Two Children**



In cases where there are two selected children with the same primary
caregiver and other caregiver (and father outside the home), enter the
Value Codes for the household (HH) Self Administered Questionnaires
(SAQs) on the first child's line. This is the line for the child with the
lowest sequence number (2 digit part of the Sample ID). On the second
child's line you will enter "7" in the fields for household questionnaires.



**Complete Households** Hold individual complete pieces until the entire household case is
completed. Your RFM/TL will tell you when and where to mail the
packets of completed household case materials. Some household cases will
be mailed to your TL for verification and evaluation, and others will be
mailed directly to Ann Arbor for coding.


**School Lines** **"Xs".**
The School lines do not use Value Codes. All fields contain
Information on schools will be entered on the FIO (Address Information)
screen and in the Call Record (F8). Note: Use the mode code for
telephone (1) when entering the call record for mailing the Teacher and
Administrator Questionnaires.


**Address Information** The name and address of the target child will be preloaded on the Address
Information screen on the child (-1) line. Enter the name and address
information on the Fl O screen for the School and Dad Out lines.


On the School Address Information Screen, use the "R" lines for the
Teacher information and the "C" lines for the Administrator. The school
name should be entered on the "Listed" line. Address I is always the
mailing address and Address 2 is for the street address, if it is different
than the mailing address.


**Interview Number**


**Status Codes**


**l**



**SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS** **4 7**


Another new and different feature for the Child Development Supplement
is the line for "Iwer IW Number" on the F 10 screen. Think ofthis as a
"case" number rather than our usual "IW number". There will be only one
number covering all lines of a completed household case. You will keep
track of your own numbers and enter the next succeeding number each
time you complete a case. This number should be entered on the F 10
screen on the **first** child line for that case. It does not need to be entered
on the other lines connected with that case. (The lwer IW# column can be
viewed by moving to the far right on the CSMS Main Browse screen.)


Enter a Call Record (F8) **every time** you make contact or attempt to
contact a respondent or informant. When there are two children in one
household, it you can "dup" the call record for the second child. When you
press FlO to save your first call record, a screen will pop up asking if you
want this call record duplicated on the other child's call record. You will
be able to change the Status Code for the second child while retaining the
ca **l** notes.


Use interim Status Codes until **all** Instruments for that line are completed.
A School line will be given a final Status Code **11** 0 l **II** when you mail the
Teacher/Administrator SAQs. A Dad Out line will be given a final Status
Code when both the Household (HH) and Child interviews have either
been completed by the Dad or a final refusal is taken.


A Child line is given a final [11] 01 [11 ] Status Code when all Permission Forms,
assessments, time diaries, and in-person and phone interviews have been
completed, all SAQs have been delivered to the household, and the Primary
Caregiver HH SAQ has been returned to the interviewer. The Other
Caregiver's SAQs may be mailed directly to Ann Arbor by the respondent.


In the rare instances when you are not able to complete all instruments for
the Child line, a Status Code _"05"_ may be used if the Primary Caregiver
Child Interview has been completed. This _"05"_ Status Code should **only**
be used when all possible means of completion have been exhausted.



**l**


**F7 Coversheet Note** For the Child Development Supplement, the F7 Coversheet Note field may
be used for information requested by your RFM or TL. Suggested entries
might include the name of the Primary Caregiver, specific appointment
notes, details of resistance, or information explaining why a case is not
currently being worked.


**48** **SECTION TWO - COVERSHEETS AND CSMS**


**Progress Reports** **On-line Progress Reports may be accessed by selecting Reports (D) on the**
**CSMS Main Menu. These Progress Reports will allow you to compare**
**your progress with that of your region and the nation. These reports are**
**updated regularly, however there may be a day or two lag between your**
**completion of lines and the time they show as completes on your report.**
**You should monitor these reports to make sure that it compares with your**
**own information. Contact your Team Leader if discrepancies persist for**
**more than a few days.**

**SECTION THRE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS**


**PART A: MAIL AHEAD TIME DIARIES**


**The purpose of the time diary is to get the best possible information about**
**the child's activities on the diary days. We will use a "mail ahead" diary**
**and ask the primary caregiver to fill it out for the target child(ren) on two**
**selected diary days before the Field Interviewer comes to conduct the**
**household interview. Encourage the respondent to fill it out, both to help**
**us get the most accurate information possible and to help shorten the**
**amount of time you will be in the household.**


**1. Time spent for an entire 24-hour period, beginning at midnight and**
**ending at midnight, must be recorded.**
**2. It is extremely important that the respondent leave no gaps in**
**accounting for his/her time during the 24 hour period. Al our analyses**
**assume that each child has 1440 minutes to spend on each selected day.**
If **the respondent doesn't want to indicate or can't remember what the**
**child did for a certain period of time, this must be noted in the diary.**
**3. Include as much detail about the activity as possible.**
**4. In addition to the activity itself, we need to know where the activity**
**took place and whether other people were involved in the activity. See**
**the specific Q by Qs for further instructions.**
**5. We are also trying to get a better understanding of secondary activities.**
**The question "Was the child doing anything else at the same time?" is**
**extremely useful in picking up activities that might not normally be**
**reported.** If **it was left blank, you need to probe for any secondary**
**activities. See the Q by Qs for further instructions.**
**6. Look over the sample time diary that is included in the first pages of the**
**time diary booklet to get an idea of the amount of detail we would like.**
**7. If, in cases where you interview two siblings, you find a discrepancy**
**between the diaries, do not revise either one in an attempt to make**
**them identical.**


**We will be collecting time diaries for two days of the week for each child:**
**one week day and one weekend day. Both children in the household will**
**be assigned the same diary days. The days of the week will be on the**
**coversheet labels, the time diary labels, and on CSMS.**


**Each household is randomly assigned one week day and one weekend day**
**for which to collect diary information. The sample will be assigned so that**
**we have an equal number of Saturdays and Sundays. The week days will**
**also be randomly assigned so that 20% of the sample is assigned to each**
**week day. Just as you cannot substitute respondents in samples of the**


5 **2sECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS**


**population, we also do not want you to switch diary days in this random**
**sample of days. If the respondent has as a problem in filling out the diary**
**on a selected day, they can switch weeks in which to fill out the diary, but**
**not days of the week. Explain to the primary caregiver before the time**
**diaries are mailed that the selected diary days can not be changed.**


**Because it is difficult to remember our activities in detail for very long, it is**
**essential that we collect the diary information as close to the diary day as**
**possible. We hope that using a "mail ahead" diary that the primary**
**caregiver fills out on the diary day will help streamline the interview and**
**also will provide us with accurate information about the child(ren)'s**
**activities on the selected days.**


**In addition to using a memory aid for respondents in the form of the mail**
**ahead diary, we will also try to make sure that our information is accurate**
**by requiring that time use diary information be collected with a 3-day**
**"window" after the weekday diary day. Research shows that it is more**
**difficult to remember activities for specific week day than it is to recall a**
**weekend day so we are tying a 3-day window to the weekday. What this**
**means is that the days of the week you can collect the diary information**
**are limited to the three days following the selected weekday diary day.**
**For example, if a household's diary day is Thursday, you would need to**
**schedule the household appointment on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Our**
**first choice is to get the appointment for the day immediately following the**
**assigned weekday, but that is not always possible.**


**You have a week window for the selected Weekend diary day. This means**
**that, for example, if your selected days were Saturday and Thursday, you**
**could take both time diaries the following Saturday. If you have a problem**
**getting both in the same week, you can split the time diaries. The diary**
**days do not have to be in the same week. You have three weeks in which**
**to retrieve, review, and edit the time diaries for both selected days.**


**If it is impossible to do a face-to-face interview within the diary window,**
**you may take the diary information over the telephone, hopefully with the**
**respondent referring to the filled-out "mail ahead" diary as this is done.**
**Please do this only as a last resort. We really want to collect the**
**information at the same time as the household session if at all possible.**



**Who gets**
**Interviewed?**



**The time diary is a difficult task for respondents to do and we have found**
**that it is often best to interview the child and primary caregiver together to**
**get the most accurate diary data. Even very young children (5 or 6 years**
**old) can often tell you what they did and the primary caregiver can help**
**anchor the times by recalling what time the child got up, ate lunch, etc. For**


**Reviewing and**

**Probing**



**5 3**
**SECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS**


older children ( age 10-12), you may take the diary information from them
without the primary caregiver's help if they clearly recall the day and can
place times on their activities. For infants and toddlers, you will take the
information about the child from the primary caregiver.


If the primary caregiver filled out the time diary ahead of time, you will still
need to review it with him or her before you leave the house. To get the
information we need, you may have to probe more extensively than usual.
Unlike the rest of the questionnaires, you do not need to record all your
probes in the time diary. Please probe any answer that is not clear to you,
since it will likely pose an even bigger problem for our coders.


Respondents may say at first that the child "just sat around all day" but on
probing you will find that they probably did get washed and dressed, ate
meals, played, went to school, talked with friends or family, watched TV or
did other things. You should probe for more detail whenever the
respondent reports an activity that took more than 4 hours ( except sleep or
going to school). For example, if the primary caregiver reports that as a
child was "playing" for 4 hours, probe to find out more about what types of
things the child did. Did (he/she) watch any TV? Go outside to play? Eat
a snack or meal?


Record activities in the respondent's own words and probe for detail, so
we know (for example) whether the target child was reading a book or
magazine, or was playing a board game or a game of hide and seek. Inhere
are gaps or overlapping times, probe to get corrected information. Also, if
some of the columns are blank, be sure they get filled in where appropriate.
Check also for legible handwriting and make sure that the respondent's
answers meet the objectives of the questionnaire as described in the
question by question objectives.



Things to look for when reviewing a time diary with the respondent:


The activities are verbs

- The activities are what the child was doing

















The activities are verbs
The activities are what the child was doing
Times are correct and add up (read each activity, the beginning and end
time out loud as you review the diary to be sure it is correct)
Probe any long periods of time (any activity lasting over 4 hours except
at school or sleeping)
Probe "playing" to find out what the child was playing
Probe "reading" to find out what the child was reading (book,
magazine) and whether the child was reading or being read to
Probe if the name of the TV shows, videos, or computer games are not
filled in
Probe if secondary activity is not filled in
Check for legible handwriting
Check for travel times

**Administering the**

**diary in person**


**Editing**



If the primary caregiver did not fill out the mail ahead diary before you
arrive in the household, please administer it as part of the primary caregiver
interview after you have completed the yellow Primary Caregiver-Child
questionnaire. If possible interview the primary caregiver and the child
together for the most accurate information. If the child is older than ten
years old, it is acceptable to interview the target child for time diary
information without the primary caregiver being present.


Editing takes place when you have finished interviewing or reviewing the
time diary with the respondent. Use the Editing Checklist (see Appendix I)
and review the completed time diary as follows:


Make sure the correct day, date, and child's name are on the front of
the face sheet.

- Make sure the correct sample label is on the back of the questionnaire.

Make sure all entries are legible.

Complete the interviewer box on the back of the questionnaire (mode,
edit length, etc). (Edit length is the time you spend cleaning up and
checking the time diary after you have left the respondent's home)

Record iw length on the back of the questionnaire. (Interview length is
the time you spent with the respondent reviewing or administering the
diary)

Note on the inside of the face sheet any unusual situations or problems
that coders should know about.

Double check to be sure the entire 24-hour period is accounted for
without gaps or overlaps.

**SECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS** **5 5**


**PART B: CHILD ASSESSMENTS**


**General Information** It is important when testing children on standardized assessment to
administer the test in a quiet environment with no other adults or children
present to disrupt the child's concentration. When setting the appointment
with the primary caregiver, make sure to tell him or her that the children
will be administered a standardized assessment. Be clear about the need to
have a space in the home that is private. Research has shown that
children's scores on these assessments are negatively affected by outside
interference of noise or people in the testing environment. Let the primary
caregiver know that any interference could negatively affect the accuracy
of the assessment.


**Stay** in **Control** As with regular interviewing, it is important to control the setting of the
assessment. For the Woodcock-Johnson easel test, place the easel at an
angle so that you and the child can both see the stimuli (pictures)
simultaneously (see picture on the next page). You will need to see the
choice that the child has made without much movement or effort. Do not
let the child flip the page forward on the easel test. Stay upbeat and
positive throughout the testing time. Children will respond to the
atmosphere that you create.


Children, especially young children, can be difficult to test and control. Try
to keep the child "on task" by repeatedly referring to and touching the easel
test. Use positive and encouraging words such as "Good job," "You are
really pointing well," "You are really good at pointing to pictures," and
"You are rea **l** y good at this." Always ID'.fild, statements that refer to the
child's progress on the test. Do nm use statements like "You got that
right," "No, that is not right,"and "Are you sure that is the right answer?"
Also, be very careful not to give any facial expression or movement of the
head that may indicate that the child has answered an item right or wrong.
The child will look at you to check their progress, especially if they are
unsure about their answer. Avoid any expression that would give them
feedback on their progress.

**SECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS** **5 7**


Be aware of the mood of the child during testing. Some children will get
very tired and just start pointing to pictures without thinking. If the child
seems to be getting tired, take a short break (5 minutes) between the sub­
tests and let the child get up and move around the testing area or get a
drink of water. Do not break during one of the sub-tests, only between
them. Do not let them leave the testing area. They may not come back.
Some children will also get bored with the task. Try to gauge whether they
are tired or just bored. If they seem bored, try to encourage them that the
assessment will be over soon. Vary the tone in your voice as well as giving
many encouraging statements.


It is important to remember that each test must be administered **exact** ~~**l**~~ **y** as
described in training and in the manual. Any deviation from these
procedures will invalidate the results. The most common mistakes made in
using standardized test by both experienced and inexperienced interviewers
is to accidentally point to the correct answer on the test or to change the
wording of the instructions. Standardized test administration should be
approached with the understanding that the instructions and wording of the
test should not vary in any way. Words cannot be added, left out, or
substituted. The goal of a standardized test is to measure how well
children respond to questions when given identical instructions. An
examiner in New York should be asking the exact same questions as an
examiner in San Francisco. When administered in this manner, the children
in both of these cities will have been given the identical test and their scores
will be based only on their ability, and not the testing situation.


There are some exceptions to the restrictions detailed above that involve a
subject's special reception and/or response limitations. Three general
groups that sometimes require small changes in the assessment procedures
are preschoolers, English-as-a-second language (ESL), and individuals with
disabilities.

Young children are often frightened of adults they do not know. If the
child refuses to be tested without a parent in the room or continua **l** y cries
because they are frightened, then ask the mother ( or primary caregiver) to
remain in the room with the child. Explain to the parent that it is important
not to assist the child in any way. If you believe that the test results are
invalid due to extra help given by the parent, please note that in the
interviewer notes at the end of the questionnaire.

**it becomes clear that the child is not proficient in English, you may switch**
**to the Spanish version. If the primary caregiver says that the child does not**

**The Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-R)Test of Achievement is an "easel" test, or**
**a test with a response book that sits in front of the respondent. Easel test**
**are administered in the.following order: The interviewer will ask the child**
**to point to an object. The child will review the options on the page and**
**point. The interviewer then records the child's response. Scoring is done**
**at the end of the interview and out of sight of the parent or child.**


**Four Subtests**


**Basal and Ceiling**

**r**


**l**



**SECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS** **5 9**


The Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement will be used in this study to
gather data on children's reading and math ability. For children 3 to _5_
years of age, only two subtests will be administered. For children 6 and
above, four subtests will be used to gather data on reading and math ability.
These test are very brief, and are interesting and enjoyable to young
children. The materials used for the test include: an easel response hook,
worksheet for calculations (5 year old and above), a scoring sheet, and a
pencil for you and the respondent. The worksheet is included in the first
three pages of the Child Interview Respondent Booklet and the scoring
sheet is on pages 2-5 of the Child questionnaire.


Scoring for the Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-R) is done using what is called
basal and ceiling. Items in the WJ-R are a **r** anged by difficulty. The easiest
questions are presented first and the items get increasingly difficult as the
child proceeds through the test. The WJ-R was designed to be used for
ages 2-90 and, therefore, presents items ranging in difficulty between those
ages. The basal and ceiling criteria were created to limit the amount of time
any one person spends on each subtest.


In the testing situation, you want to start testing at the appropriate starting
point for the respondent's abilities. Unfortunately, we don't know that
ahead oftime so we use the education level of the adult or child as a
guideline. At the beginning of every subtest, usua **l** y on the first page, there
is chart that tells the interviewer what item they should start administering
the test (see example below).



**r**


**l**



**r**


**l**



**r**


**l**


To administer the test, the interviewer turns to the page where the starting
item is located. The interviewer begins administering the test. If
respondent gets _**six or more consecutive items co"ect**_ then they have
established their _**basal.**_ The interviewer continues testing until the
respondent establishes _**ceiling**_ which is _**six or more consecutive items**_
_**inco"ect and**_
_**the end of the testing page has been reached**_


**60sECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS**


**Test Complete Pages** **One important concept to remember about the** **WJ-R** **is that you always test**
**in complete pages. You never stop testing in the middle of a page. If you**
**start a new page, even if the respondent reaches basal or ceiling at the**
**beginning or middle of the page, you have to complete the full page. This**
**way the respondent does not know that they have reached the criteria set**
**by the WJ-R. This idea of testing in complete pages is especially important**
**when finding the basal and ceiling. For example, if you are testing a child**
**and start with item** 13 **and the child does not get six in a row correct, you**
**must then test backward by complete pages starting at the beginning or top**
**of each page and going to the end. It is possible that a child will never get**
**6 consecutive items complete before they reach Item 1 of the subtest. In**
**these cases the basal is considered to be Item** 1. **All you would need to**
**find is their ceiling. If you are trying to establish** _**ceiling,**_ **it is likely that a**
**child will get 6 consecutive items wrong in a row but not be at the end of**
**the page. Sometimes when you continue testing to finish the page, a child**
**will get an item correct. If they get an item correct, even after they have**
_**both 6**_
**reached ceiling, you must continue testing them until they get**
_**consecutive items inco"ect and have reached the end of the page.**_


**Scoring** **When a respondent gets an item correct, record a "l" on the scoring sheet.**
**If the respondent gets an answer wrong, record a "O." You should always**
**try to stay consistent with your hand movements when marking the**
**answers. The respondent will be watching you for feedback. When**
**computing the raw score for each sub-test, the general rule is that the**
**respondent receives credit for all items scored as correct. The respondent**
**also receives credit for items on which they are not tested, but which are**
**below their basal. Thus, if you start on Item 24 and the respondent**
**achieves basal on Item 29 then the respondent has a score of 29 at that**
**point. Any correct items that they score above the basal while ceiling is**
**being established, will be added to the 29. Let's say they get the next 6**
**items incorrect and are at the end of the page. They reached the ceiling**
**right after the basal and thus their score would remain at 29. Had this**
**respondent gotten 4 more items correct before geting 6 consecutive items**
**wrong ( and to the end of the page), they would have received a raw score**
**of 33.**


**For the children who are age 6 or higher, you will be administering the**
**calculations test. This involves referring the child to the worksheet in their**
**respondent book and having them work math problems. You must monitor**
**the child while doing the calculations and make sure that they are on the**
**correct problem and that they are getting them correct. You should tum**
**the pages in the easel book so that you can see what the correct answer**
**should be. The same basal and ceiling rules apply for the subtest, including**
**going backwards by item if the child does not reach basal. The children are**
**also allowed to use a "scratch" piece of paper to work on the Applied**


**WISC - Digit Span**


**Tips on Primary**
**Caregiver**

**Assessments**



**SECTION THREE - TIME DIARIES & ASSESSMENTS** **61**


Problems test. For this "piece of paper", you can use the inside of the back
cover of the child respondent booklet. You do not need to monitor what
they are doing on the piece of paper except for the time it takes them.


This is a clinical instrument for assessing the memory ability of children.
The interviewer reads a list of numbers to the child and the child is asked to
repeat the sequence back. The child verbally repeats the sequence
backward and forward. This is a quick, easy test that involves no extra
materials. Children usually respond well to this test.


Administering assessments to primary caregivers is usually not a problem
for interviewers. Some interviewer have found that if they assess the
primary caregiver before the assessing the children he or she can serve as a
role model for the children. One issue to be aware of in this case is that,
with older children, the primary caregiver may go over the same material
that the child will when assessed. In this case, you do not want the child to
hear the answers the primary caregiver gives before the child takes the
assessment.


Some primary caregivers may be uneasy taking the assessment. You will
usually find this in cases where the primary caregiver does not have good
English skills or where there may be a problem with low educational
attainment or literacy. You want to be sensitive to these cases and
administer the assessment where the primary caregiver' s children or other
household members cannot hear the answers.

SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES** & **QXQs** **6 7**


Note carefully the amount of time that is given for each page.


**A.**
This starts the diary sequence for each activity ( other than the first one,
which will be "sleeping" for most children). Record R's answer verbatim.


We are particularly interested in getting as much detail as possible about
educational activities that the child may be doing, interactions the child has
with others, and what sort of"playing" children do. If the activity is listed
as "playing," probe to find out what type of playing was (he/she) doing was she playing a board game? A game of make-believe? A game of
f **o** tball in the back yard? If the child was "reading," we want to
distinguish between reading by (him/her)self, and being read to by a parent
or other person.


To help you understand the types of distinctions we are looking for, below
are some of the code categories we will be using.


**Classes, lessons:**
We distinguish between the type of classes ( computer classes, sports
lessons, music lessons, etc.)


**Playing:**
We distinguish between playing pretend games like dress up or playing
house; playing social games with others; playing with toys; playing
computer games; and other types of playing like working on a model
airplane or swinging.


**Interaction:**
We are interested irt things like phone conversations, being read to or
listening to a story, arguing or fighting, being disciplined, and talking or
having conversations.


**TV Watching:**

IfR said (he/she) was ' [1] flipping channels" rather than watching a
_"TV'_ and record
specific program, list that as the activity and record as
"flipping channels" at the question that asks for the name of the
program R was watching. IfR was flipping between two different
programs while watching them both, record _"TV'_ and the name of both
programs in column E.


**B.**

Except for the first activity, the start time should be the same as the end
time for the previous activity. It is very important to ask this question and
not just assume that the start time is the same as the end of the previous
activity.


6 8 **SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


C.
Record the time that R stopped this activity.


D.
lf R said he/she was "watching TV," you will be prompted to ask whether
this was a TV program or a video tape. A TV program can be network or
cable. If R was watching a tape of a TV network or cable TV program on
their VCR, code "TV."


E.
Record each TV program, video or game watched/played. If R was
watching two programs at the same time, record the name of both
programs. If R played several video games for a few minutes each, record
the names of each game played. Record the names of up to three games,
videos, or programs.


**F.**
This question need not be asked if location is obvious, such· as when R was
sleeping or at school. Here are some samples of how to think of locations:


**Child's Home:**
This means in the child's home or outside in the yard.


**School:**
This includes any school or child care center ( not in a church or
community center},whether or not R is enrolled there. **It** can include
the school of a sibling, or attending a concert or play in a school
auditorium. It also includes playing in the neighborhood school yard.


**Child's Other Parent's Home:**
This refers to the home of an absent parent (in the case of divorced or
separated parents)


**Someone Else's Home:**
This refers to any home other than R's home or the home of the absent
parent. **It** can be a friend's house, a grandparent's house, or the home
of a babysitter.


**Church:**
This includes any church, synagogue, or place of worship (including
attending worship services or a preschool that is located at church).


**Parent's Work:**
Code if the child was at work with either parent.


SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES** & **QXQs** **6 9**


**Daycare Center:**
This refers to a preschool program or child care center. A day care
center is defined as an establishment where children are cared for in a
group in a non-residential setting for all or part of the day. (Not home­
based day care)


**Restaurants, fast fod places and their parking lots:**


**Indoor Recreation Places:**
This includes places like theaters, or youth recreation centers.


**Outdoor Recreation Places:**
Parks, R's neighborhood, etc.


**Stores:**
Stores, shopping centers, malls and their parking lots, beauty parlor.


**Banks, Offices, Library, Fire Station, etc.:**


**Other:**
This includes all hospitals, parking structures, and other locations not
specified above.


**Transit:**

This code is used whenever R is going from one place to another. It
can be in a bus going to school, going to the grocery store with a
parent, or walking to the park. Riding a bike or walking around the
neighborhood would not be considered "transit" unless R was going to
another location. If R was walking or riding around for exercise or
pleasure, code location as "Other."


**G.**

This question should not be asked if R is sleeping or involved in personal
care such as getting dressed, washing up, etc. Here we want to know who
was participating in the activity with the child. (We ask in the next
question who was also in the house with the child). So, if mother was
making dinner while the child was doing homework, mother would be
coded as being in the house but not as doing homework with the child. If
mother was helping the child with homework, then "mother" would be
entered in column G. The codes to be used are listed below:


Mother
Grandparent or great grandparent of child
Father Other relative of child

Other non relative of child
Brother or sister
(Child) Friend of child


**7 0** **SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


**H.**
Note that this question is not asked if R is sleeping or involved in personal
care such as getting dressed, washing up, etc.


This question refers to other people who were in the same location as R
when R was doing the activity. IfR was doing homework at home, then
we want to know who else was in the house at the time. If R was playing
at a friend's house, we want to know who else was in the friend's house.


We will use the same codes as those in Column G.


**J.**
Note that this question is not asked ifR is sleeping or involved in personal
care such as getting dressed, washing up, etc.

Child, 3-12 years old


To obtain information on the cognitive and social ability of children in the
specified age range.


The Woodcock-Johnson R and the Digit Span assessment must be
administered **exactly** as written. No wording can be changed, added, or
deleted.
The Respondent book must be used for all children.


To obtain information on ...

- children's reading and math ability

- children's memory.

- the self-esteem of children as it relates to school subjects and to their
general lives.

- children's day at school.

Interviewer checkpoint: The checkpoints on the first page of the interview
are designed to take you through several decision points for children who
may not speak English as their first language. For children in school
(Kindergarten or higher), we will attempt to do the assessment in English.
Children not yet in school will be assessed only if they speak English. **If**
there is any doubt, ask the primary caregiver if the child speaks English.

Ask the primary caregiver (for small children) or the child if R usua **l** y
wears glasses or a hearing aid. **If** so, be sure R has them on for the
assessment so the assessments can be as accurate as possible.


**7 2** SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs


**A3.**
You will need to know what grade the child is in (for school aged children)
in order to determine where to begin the assessment. We find out in the
primary caregiver questionnaire the child's grade level. If you already
know the child's grade in school, it is acceptable to enter it here without
asking the question.


**Woodcock.Johnson** The Woodcock-Johnson is an educational assessment. Depending on the
age of the child, either 2 or 4 subscales of the Woodcock-Johnson will be
administered during the interview:


           - Letter-Word Identification: 3-12 year olds

          - Passage Comprehension: 6-12 year olds

           - Calculation: 6-12 year olds

           - Applied Problems: 3-12 year olds


**Read Qs as Written** It is important to read the instructions in the Woodcock-Johnson easel
book and follow them exactly.


**Sample Items** For children in 2nd grade or lower, administer all of the sample items
before starting the assessment. For children grade 3 and higher, only
administer Sample A for Letter-Word, Passage Comprehension and
Calculation. No sample is administered for Applied Problems for grades 3
and up.


**Recording Answers** Use pages 2-5 in the questionnaire to record the responses: record "l" for
correct answers, and record "0 [11 ] for incorrect answers.


Allow the respondent a reasonable amount of time to answer, and then
move on even though (he/she) might get the answer if given more time to
think. For calculation problems that a child is struggling with, allow at
most approximately double the child's average time to compute an answer,
and then have (him/her) move on to the next problem.



**Raw Score**



Count up the number of correct answers and put the total in the "Raw
Score" box provided. Questions not asked because they are below basal
are counted as correct for the raw score. Please check the total twice to
make sure it is correct.


SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs** **7 3**


**Respondent Booklet** For computation, the respondent uses the respondent book for calculating
answers. It is best to take the respondent booklet back from R after the
Woodcock Johnson assessment is completed, to help keep (him/her)
focused on the Digit Span assessment that comes next.


**Section B** **Digit Span**

This is another type of assessment, which tests the child's memory. Follow
the instructions exactly as written on page 6. If the child does not
understand the instructions, you may read them a second time but you
cannot give any examples for the Digits Forward section before beginning.
For Digits Backward (Page 9), you can read the instructions and example
to R only once.


Remember to say "ready?" before each set of numbers. Note the
instructions to "circle" the correct answer rather than using an "X"

This section is administered to respondents aged 8-12 years old. The

old.


Read the instructions as written on Page 11, to help familiarize the
respondent with using the Respondent Booklet. If you are certain that R
understands that task, then do not read second example. IfR does not read,
you will need to read the answer categories to (him/her) after each
question. They are included in (parentheses) after each question.

**Time Diary**
This section is only to be administered to children in middle school or
elementary schools where the children change classrooms and have
multiple teachers for their core academic subjects. The reason for this
section is that we can't get a school time diary for children who have
different teachers every hour of the day (since no one teacher can fill out an
accurate diary for an entire day for the child). Instead of asking the
teacher, we ask the kids for school diary information in this section.


**7 4** **SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


**Note that children under 8 years old get skipped to D 1. It will be very rare**
**that young children are in a middle-school like setting, but we know that**
**some elementary schools are set up like middle schools. Also, middle**
**schools start at different grades, so we have to ask everyone. If the child**
**has one main teacher but has different teachers for subjects like art and**
**gym, that counts as "one classroom" and the child should be skipped out of**
**Section D. Only check "2. Different classrooms and teachers" if the child**
**has different teachers for core subjects like math, social studies, language**
**arts, spelling, etc. It is acceptable to skip this question and mark "1. One**
**teacher" for preschool-aged children, since they may not understand the**
**question and tell you that they have more than one "teacher" in their class.**


**Please don't forget to record the end time at D 14 if you skip out of Section**
**D!**


**D2.**
**We want to get diary information for the child for the selected weekday**
**diary day if at all possible. On (rare) occasions, the child will not have been**
**in school on that day due to school closing, illness, or vacations. If that is**
**the case, choose the day nearest to the diary day and ask about that day**


**D3.**
**Record the day of the week and date for which you get diary information**
**from the child.**


**D4-D13.**
**The goal of the questions on pages 18-19 is to get an accurate picture of**
**how the child spend (his/her) day at school. Administer this grid by**
**working across the 2-page spread, first asking D4, then D5, through D13,**
**for the first activity of the school day; and then asking D4 - D 13 for the**
**second activity, and so on for the entire time R is in school. These**
**questions are only for the time school is in session. IfR attends before- or**
**after-school activities, those are not to be included in this diary.**


**D4-D5.**
**Record each activity on a separate line. Often the activity will be the same**
**as a subject (e.g., I went to math class), and you do not need to write**
**"math class" twice for the same activity. If R can give us information at a**
**more detailed level (e.g., in second hour math class we did worksheets for**
**a half hour and then had a half hour of lecture), record the activities**
**(worksheets and lecture) separately.**


**D6-D7.**
**Record the beginning and end time of each activity. Please mark "am" or**
**"pm" for each entry.**


**Section E**



**SECTION FOUR -** **QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs** **7 5**


**D8.**
Ask the question, and instruct R to look at Column B of the respondent
booklet to give you the number of the response category. Record the
number of R's answer in the space provided. IfR gives you an "other"
answer, record R's answer verbatim so it can be coded in Ann Arbor. IfR
gives you more than one location, enter them all.


IfR has trouble reading the categories, you can read them to (him/her)
from the Respondent Book.


**D9-D13.**
Like D8, ask the questions, and write down the code number(s) of R's
answers for each activity. It is possible for R to give multiple answers to
any of these questions.


**Pages 20-23**
Use these pages for additional activities if necessary.


When you have finished the last entry for the school day, go to Page 24
and record the end time of the interview at D14.


**Interviewer Information**
This interviewer observation section should be completed as soon as
possible after you leave the household, while the interview is still fresh in
your mind. You should answer the questions for observations seen during
the whole time you were in the home and not just during the interview
itself If there are unusual situations, you may want to jot some notes down
while you are still in the household to help you fill out this section
completely


**El.**
The intent of this series of questions is to determine if anyone interfered
with the assessment of the child. It is important for us to know if the
information we receive on the assessments is truly accurate of the child's
cognitive ability.

Mother/Primary Caregiver


Face to Face (Preferred)
Phone ( Optional)


To obtain information about the health, behavior, education, and general
environment of the child.


Passage Comprehension assessment must be given only **once** to the
Mother/Primary Caregiver.
A tape measurer or ruler **must** be used to complete this b **o** klet.
Respondent b **o** k may be used for this interview


To obtain information on

- mother/primary caregivers literacy.

- children's health history.

- home environment.

- children's schooling.

- children's behavior.

- household tasks.

- parental involvement in school.

- parental monitoring of children's activities and friends.

 - child care history.

- relationship with absent parent (if applicable).

- f **o** d availability in the home.


**Child label**
Place the child label on the inside of this questionnaire, to help you
remember which child this questionnaire is referencing. We will take out
the name before coding the questionnaire in A **n** Arbor.


**AO.**
Please record the starting time of this interview.


SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES** & **QXQs** **77**


**Al.**
The Woodcock-Johnson assessment should be administered to the primary
caregiver only once. For caregivers with two children in the study, you
will skip to Page 3 for the second child interview.


**A2**
Using the fold-out carpenter's ruler provided in your materials, measure
the child and record (his/her) height in inches. If the child is not in the
household when you come to this question, you can come back and enter
the information later. (And by the same token, if the child is leaving before
you get to the primary caregiver interview; or you need to do this interview
by phone, be sure to get the child's height when doing the child
assessment.)


**A4.**
The response options are not read for this question. You will need to code
the answer based on R's response. If necessary, read the response options
to R to get a codeable answer.


**A5.**

Please ask **R**
to spell the city to make sure you have it down correctly. If R
was born outside of the U.S., record the city and leave the state blank if the
country does not have states.


**A6.**
This question needs to be asked even if the answer seems obvious. If
necessary, you can use the "I need to ask all questions in the order they
appear in the questionnaire" phrase as a preface to this question.


**A7.**
Record an answer in only one of the three boxes. Note that the first box is
for days or weeks **before** the due date; the middle box is to be marked if
the child was born **after** the due date, and the bottom box should be
checked if the child was born on the due date.


**A9-A12.**
Some respondents may not know the answer to these questions, if the child
is adopted or the primary caregiver is not the biological mother. Do not
probe "don't know" answers to questions A9-A12.


**A9a.**
Probe for the diagnosis that was given by the doctor as the reason for
putting (him/her) in the neonatal intensive care unit. Premature birth is not
a sufficient answer. Probe for what about the premature birth put them in
the unit (e.g. did not weigh enough). IfR gives you the name of a specific
condition or disease, ask for the correct spelling to help the coders.


**7 8** **SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


**AlOa.**
If parent answers in terms of years, please write the answer verbatim in the
margin and multiply by 12 to record the answer in months.


**A13.**
IfR has volunteered before this time that (he/she) is not the child's
biological mother, you do not need to ask this question. Mark the box and
follow the skip.


**A14.**
Medicaid is for low-income people who must meet eligibility requirements.
Medicaid is administered by states and has different names in different
states. In most states it is called Medicaid and is administered through the
state or county medical assistance department. Exceptions to this are in
the state of California (Medi-Cal), Arizona (Arizona Health Care Cost
Containment System-AHCCCS). A medical assistance program may be in
the form of an HMO, but it must be administered by the state or county
medical assistance or welfare departments, not a private or employer HMO
plan.


**A15.**
IfR does not know what the WIC program is, read the definition in the
box.


**A18.**
ADC (Aid to Dependent Children) and AFDC (Aid to Families with
Dependent Children) covers needy single parents with children under age
18, as well as two-parent families with the father present in the household
but not working.


Please read the acronyms ADC and AFDC to R; and clarify with the full
name only if necessary.


**A19.**
This question asks about assistance other than that already mentioned in
A15-Al8. IfRs respond that they receive welfare, make sure that it is
something other than ADC or AFDC, or welfare already coded above. If it
is ADC or AFDC, go back to Al 8 and make sure that is coded correctly
before continuing and do not include that assistance here.


**A20.**
We want the number of different times the child was in the hospital for in­
patient care, not counting the hospital stay when the child was born. If the
child was in the hospital more than once for the same illness, that counts as
multiple hospital stays.


SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES** & **QXQs** **7 9**


**A20b.**
If there is any doubt, please ask the respondent to spell the name of the
condition or illness for which the child was hospitalized.


**A21.**
Only mark "yes" for conditions that R was told about by a doctor or health
professional. A health professional includes nurse, physician's assistant,
nurse practitioner, social worker, or counselor. If R volunteers that the
child has a condition (e.g., asthma) but says it has not been diagnosed by a
doctor or health professional, check "no" and make a marginal note.


**A2lj.**
If respondent says "yes," ascertain that a doctor or health professional said
that the child had this problem.


**A21q.**
If R's respond that the child has Autism or ADHD, A21q should be marked
"no" and those problems should be coded in 21r or 21s. A21q is only for
lear **n** ig disabilities other than those listed in the A21 series. If (for
example) "Autism" is volunteered at A21 q, probe for other lear **n** ig
disabilities at A21 q, and mark A21 r as "yes" without asking the question
again. Ask the respondent to spell the name of the disability, and try to get
the full name rather than an abbreviation or acronym.


**A21s.**
ADHD is Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder; and ADD is Attention
Deficit Disorder.


**A21t.**
lfR says "no" when asked about other problems, circle "S [=] No." IfR gives
you a problem, write the answer in the space provided and circle "l [=] Yes."


**A22.**
This question refers only to physical illness. Injury and emotional problems
are covered in later questions. "Other health professional" includes
physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, etc. Note that the frame of
reference for this question is the last 12 months.


**A22a.**
Note that the frame of reference for this question is "ever'' - which is
different from A22.


**A22b.**
If there is any doubt, ask R to spell the name of the illness. If the child was
seen for multiple illnesses at that time, record all of them.


**80**
SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs


**A23.**
This question refers only to injury (e.g., broken leg, wound, bum).
Physical illness and emotional problems are covered in other questions.
"Other health professional" includes physician's assistant, nurse
practitioner, etc. Note that the frame of reference for this question is the
last 12 months.


**A23a.**
Note that the frame of reference for this question is "ever" - which is
different from A23.


**A23b.**
We want the specific injury or injuries for which the child was seen (e.g.,
"broken arm"); not the cause of the injury ("fell off a swing").


**A24.**
Note that the frame of reference is "ever" for this question, which is
different from A22 and A23.


**A26.**
Even if the child is not school aged, these questions should be asked. We
want to know if (he/she) has a condition that could limit these activities
when (he/she) is older.


**A29a.**
This is the first place where R uses the respondent booklet. Briefly tell R
that you will be using the booklet for answers to some of the questions,
and refer (him/her) to Page I for this question.


**A31.**
This question refers to health care insurers like an HMO (Health
Maintenance Organization) or PPO (Preferred Provider Organization), or
any health care organization where a primary care physician is used.


**A33.**
Read "you" if the primary caregiver is the only adult in the household.
Read "your family" from the parentheses if there is more than one adult in
the household. "Your family" refers to the adults living in the Household
withR.


**Section B**



**SECTION FOUR -** **QUESTIONNAIRES** **&** **QXQs** **81**


**Bl.**
**This is the first of several places where we you need to "ask or verify" the**
**information.** If **you already know that the child lives with (his/her)**
**biological mother and father, you do not need to ask Bla-Bld. Mark the**
**boxes for BI a and BI b "1. Living with child" and BI c and BI d should be**
**marked "3. Does not have." You would have to ask B le "Does (CHil..D)**
**have a father figure?" and if R says "yes" you may need to probe to find**
**out if that person lives with the child.**


**Ble.**
**A father-figure is a male who is not the biological/adoptive father or**
**stepfather but functions as father in the care of the child. Often this is a**
**grandfather or the boyfriend of the primary caregiver.**


**B2.**
If **the child has a father, stepfather or father figure living in the household,**
**continue with B3 and ask B3-B5 about that person.**


**B3.**
**Choose the phrase from the parentheses based on which male figure is**
**living with the child.** If **child lives with both a father and a father-figure,**
**choose the biological/adoptive or stepfather as the focus of this question.**


**BS.**
**"Mother" refers to biological, step, adoptive, or foster mother.** If **child**
**does not have a mother, choose "7. Never'' for the response and it is not**
**necessary to ask this question, since it is not possible for the child to eat**
**with the mother and father.**


**B6.**
If **the child does not have one or more of these relationships, do not ask the**
**question and mark the** _"N'_ **box.**


**Bll.**
**Your bulk materials will include a yellow half-page cue card for this**
**question. Some respondents have difficulty remembering the response**
**options for this question, so we have provided a card to hand R as needed.**


**B13a.**
**This question concerns when spanking first began for the child. Probe for**
**the age of child when the primary caregiver can first remember spanking**
**the child.**


**8 2** **SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


**B16.**
If necessary, you can read the response options to R. Most respondents
will give you a number which can be easily coded without reading the
response options.


**B17.**
This checkpoint routes you to the section of questions appropriate to the
child's age.



**Section C**


**Section D**



**Cl.**
"Getting out of the house" includes anything that is outside of R's home:
such as going to the store with mom, playing in the yard, going to child
care or preschool, etc.


**cs.**
This question refers to working at home. It can be housework or work for
a business, but must be done in the home.


**C6.**
For long series of questions, repeat the response options if you think R has
lost track of the categories. They are included in (parentheses) at items
C6e and C6k as a reminder, but you can repeat them whenever needed. If
**R**
is using the RB and is clearly understanding the options, you do not need
to repeat them.


**cs.**
WIC is a governmental program for low-income women, infants, and
children.


**D2.**
Read the words (children's, scientific, art, historical, etc.) in parentheses as
part of the question.


**D3.**
Outing refers to a fun activity not an activity related to child care or
business. Read the words (shopping, park, picnic, drive-in, etc.) in
parentheses as part of the question.


**D4.**
Read "or another adult" if there is more than one adult living in the
household. Read "or an older child" if there is an older child living in the
household.


**Section E**


**Section F**


**Section G**

**l**



SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs** **8 3**


**El.**
This question concerns reading books that are not for school but ones the
child has chosen to read or has available to read sometime in the future.


**E3.**
Read the words (for example, piano, drum, guitar, etc.) in parentheses as
part of the question.


**ES.**
Read the words (children's, scientific, art, historical, etc.) in parentheses as
part of the question.


**ElOk.**
lf R answers no other things, write ''None" in the space provided and do
not circle a response in the grid.


**Fl.**
This question concerns reading books that are not for school but ones the
child has chosen to read or has available to read at some time in the future.


**F3.**
Read the words (for example, piano, drum, guitar, etc.) in parentheses as
part of the question.


**F5.**
Read the words (children's, scientific, art, historical, etc.) in parentheses as
part of the question.


**Fllk.**
IfR answers no other things, write "None" in the space provided and do
not circle a response in the grid.


**G6.**

ed Free or Reduced Lunch
Federal School Breakfast Program is often ca **l**
Program.


**GlO.**
Option 3 is Home School and is for children who are taught by their
parents or in some cooperative group of parents. If child is in Home
School, the parent who is teaching the child should receive the Elementary
Teacher Questionnaire.


**84** **SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


**Gil.**
Be careful to distinguish between private/religious and private /non­
religious schools.


**Gile.**
It is important to distinguish how often the schools are paid. Be sure to
ask the parent how often they pay the amount that the give for the first part
of G 11 c. Read the response options only if necessary to code the time
unit.


**G12.**
"Special class" in this context refers to any advanced class or gifted class,
and not a special class for lear **n** ig disabilities or special education.


**G13.**
Special education is for children with lear **n** ig disabilities or language
problems.


**G14.**
Head Start, Even Start, and Fair Start are all government programs for
low-income children.


**G16.**
IfR cannot recall how old the child was when (he/she) started
kindergarten, probe for the month and year (he/she) started kindergarten.
We can compute the age from the child's birth date. If the child did not go
to kindergarten, ask about first grade and make a marginal note that the
age is for first grade rather than kindergarten.


**G21.**
The response options are not included in the text of the question, because
most respondents will answer in ways that are easily coded. If necessary, it
is acceptable to read the response options to R.


**G24.**
Your bulk materials will include **a** yellow half-page **cue card** for this
question. Some respondents have difficulty remembering the response
options for this question, so we have provided a card to hand R as needed.


**G28d.**
An informal meeting is a meeting that was not scheduled or planned by
either the teacher or the parent.


**G28e.**
An informal meeting is a meeting that was not scheduled or planned by
either the principal or parent.

**Section H**


**r**



SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES** & **QXQs** **8 5**


**G28f.**
The PT A is the Parent-Teacher Association. This question also refers to
PTO (Parent-Teacher Organizations) and other similar organizations.


**G29.**
When reading these questions, be sure that R is answering in terms of how
often each thing has made it difficult for R to be involved in the child's
school, **not** how often each thing happened. If there is any doubt of R's
understanding the intent of the question, add the phrase "How often has
this made it difficult for you to be involved in (CHIT.,D's) school
activities?" to the question.


**G29c.**
This question concerns the parents inability to understand the school
assignment, **not** the child's inability to understand or do the assignment.


**G29i.**
IfR answers "no other things," write "None" in the space provided and do
not circle a response in the grid.


**G34.**
IfR asks for a definition of"close friends," use the MTY probe.


**G35.**
This question refers to the same friends as R gave in the G34 answer.


**G36.**
This question asks about all people the child may be with, not just close
friends.


**G38.**
Parenting classes can include Lamaze or any classes that involve
discussions of f
**e** ding, caring for, raising children, etc.


**Hl.**
It is important to emphasize "regular arrangement." It must be at least
once a week for a month to be considered a regular child care a **r** angement.


**H2-H10.**
This is another two-page grid, which is worked down the column for each
child care arrangement. For the first child care arrangement that R used for
the child, ask H2, then H3, and H4 on Page 48; then go to HS through HIO
on Page 49. After Arrangement #I is complete, ask H2-HI0 for
Arrangement #2, and so on until all child care arrangements are covered
from birth until the child started school (kindergarten). If there are more


**8 6**
**SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


than 3 child care arrangements, go to Pages 50-51 for arrangements 4-6,
and Pages 52-53 for arrangements 7-9. IfR had more than 9 regular child
care arrangements between birth and the time the child started school,
make a note in the margin about how many other a **r** angements R had but
do not ask questions H2-Hl O for them.


It is possible for a respondent to have two child care arrangements at the
same time (e.g., a babysitter 3 days a week, and preschool 2 days a week).
Each of those would be coded as a separate arrangement.


**H2.**
Refer the respondent to Column A in the Respondent Booklet ( we used
columns so the R would not have to flip RB pages back and forth if they
have several child care arrangements).


**H3.**
Try to get the child's age in both years and months (e.g., 2 years and 5
months) if possible.


**B4.**
**Relative under 13 in the child's home**           - This will generally be regular
care by the child's brother or sister under age 13.


**Relative 13 or older in the child's home**            - This includes care by an older
brother or sister, a grandmother, or any other relative. Do not include the
child's parents. We will know about their care from the time diary.


**Nonrelative in the child's home**           - This is regular care provided by
someone not related to the child in the child's home. This will usually be a
sitter; however, it includes care by a nanny or au pair. The age of the
nonrelative does not matter here. It includes a teen babysitter, for example,
if the care occurs on a regular basis.


**Care in a relative's home**           - The child is related to the caregiver and the
care takes place in the relative' s home.


**Care in a nonrelative's home**           - This is often called family day care.
Family day care is care provided for a sma **l** group of children in the
caregiver's home. Often a family day care provider is a mother with
children of her own at home. The caregiver may be a friend, a neighbor, or
the woman down the street that cares for children. The crucial factor is
that the caregiver is not related to the child and the care is in the
caregiver' s home.


**SECTION FOUR -** **QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs** **8 7**


**Head Start Program - Head Start is the foremost early childhood**
**program for low income children and their families. It consists of a**
**preschool or nursery school program for groups of children and their**
**teachers. It also includes social and health services.** As **with other**
**preschool programs, it occurs in a center-based environment. Parents**
**whose children are in Head Start will know it.** If **the parent is not sure of**
**the program's name, it is probably not Head Start. There are a variety of**
**other programs in operation with similar names that may include a**
**preschool program for children.** If **they include center-based care for**
**children, include it under "Prekindergarten program, nursery school,**
**preschool, or child care center;" or "Before or after school program;"**
**depending on whether the child is enrolled in school or not.**


**Prekindergarten program, nursery school, preschool, or child care**
**center - These are all establishments where children are cared for in a**
**group in a nonresidential setting for all or part of the day. All provide**
**some form of educational program as well as play and recreational**
**activities for young children.** If **the child is school-age, please code the**
**care under "Before or after school program."**


**Before or after-school program - Many centers have developed**
**programs specifically for school-age children and many schools also**
**provide such programs. They may be in the school building or in a**
**separate building, with transportation from one to the other. A**
**before-school program is a special program that children attend before their**
**official school-day begins. An after-school program is a program that**
**children attend after their official school-day ends until their parents are**
**able to pick them up after work.** If **a child is in a before or after-school**
**program in a private home, please code that under the appropriate category**
**for home-based care, either relative or nonrelative, in the child's or the**
**caregiver's home.**


**Child cares for self alone - In some cases parents leave children to care**
**for themselves for periods between the end of the school day and the**
**parent arrival after work.** If **the child is truly alone with no adult and no**
**older sibling, the child is caring for himself** If **the child has an older sibling**
**there, it would be "Care by a relative under age** 13" **or "Care by a relative**
**over age** 13." If **the child is caring for a younger sibling, this child is caring**
**for himself and the younger sibling is being cared for by a relative over or**
**under age 13 in the child's home.**


**Other type of child care, specify - Please write out what the parent says**
**if it does not appear to fit into any of the above categories.**


**None** -If **a child is only cared for occasionally but not regularly, by**
**someone other than the parent, please code "none."**


**8 8**
**SECTION FOUR - QUESTIONNAIRES & QXQs**


**HS.**
Try to get the child's age in both years and months (e.g., 2 years and 5
months) if possible.


**H9.**
For this question, write the letter for the **main reason** that R quit the child
care arrangement. If R give more than one reason, probe for one main

reason.


**Hll.**
Interviewer checkpoint: The next question in this series concern the
**current** child care arrangement for school-age children. Make sure to
emphasize that this is the current arrangement, is ongoing, and used at least
once a week for a month (i.e., a regular child care arrangement). For
children not yet in kindergarten, we already have the current arrangement
coded in the H2-Hl0 series.


**H12.**
See Q by Qs for H4 for the definitions of these child care categories.


**H13.**
Interviewer checkpoint: IfR reports no current child care arrangements,
this section is complete. IfR responds with 1 or more types of regular
child care in HI2, proceed through this section answering the appropriate
questions for each child care arrangement.


IfR uses only one child care arrangement, you are instructed to write the
letter of the arrangement type at Hl4. If the arrangement is coded A, B, or
D, ask HI 4a before skipping out to Hl 8.


**H14-H17.**
These questions ask the R to prioritize the a **r** angement in H12 by the
amount of time each week the child spends at the child care arrangement.
Have R choose response options from the Respondent Booklet. When
you have ranked all the child care arrangements in order of time spent, go
to HI 8 and ask detailed questions about each child care arrangement.


**H14a, H15a, H16a, H17a**
Note that the relationship question is asked only ifR has responded A, B,
or D in the previous question.


SECTION FOUR - **QUESTIONNAIRES** & **QXQs** **8 9**


**H15.**
This is left blank if R has only one child care arrangement marked at H12.
IfR uses two child care arrangements, you can mark the answer without
asking HIS. Mark the answer, and ask H15a if the arrangement is coded
A, B, or D. IfR has 3 or more child care arrangements marked at H12,
you will need to ask Hl 5 and record the answer.


**H16.**
This is left blank if R has two or fewer child care arrangements marked at
Hl 2. IfR has three child care arrangements, you can mark the answer
without reading the question. Ask Hl6a if the arrangement is coded A, B,
or D. IfR has 4 or more child care arrangements, ask Hl6 and record the

answer.


**H17.**
This is left blank ifR has three or fewer child care arrangements marked at
H12. IfR has four child care arrangements, you can mark the answer
without reading the question. Ask Hl 7a if the arrangement is coded A, B,
or D. IfR has 5 or more child care arrangements, ask Hl 7 and record the

answer.


**H18-H22.**
This is a detailed set of questions asking about the child care arrangement
R uses most for the child. Be sure to refer R to the arrangement listed at
H14.


**H23.**
This interviewer checkpoint skips you out of the rest of the section ifR had
only one child care arrangement. If R had 2 or more arrangements, you are
instructed to ask questions H24-H28 about the second most used
arrangement (which was listed in HIS).


**H29.**
This interviewer checkpoint skips you out of the rest of the section ifR had
two or fewer child care arrangements. IfR had 3 or more arrangements,
you are instructed to ask questions H30-H3 4 about the third most used
arrangement (which was listed in Hl6).


**H35.**
This interviewer checkpoint skips you out of the rest of the section ifR
three or fewer child care arrangements. IfR had 4 or more arrangements,
you are instructed to ask questions H36-H40 about the fourth most used
a **r** angement (which was listed in Hl 7). Not many respondents will go

regular child care arrangements at the same time.

repeat the response categories as needed.


**Cl.**
This set of questions does not have a "neither agree nor disagree" middle
category. Since that was an option in the previous question, you will need
to probe "in general, would you say you agree, or disagree" ifR tries to
give you a "neither" response. This is a lengthy series; so repeat the
response categories whenever you feel R may be forgetting the full range
of options available.

SECTION 5

INTERVIEWING CHILDREN


110


TOC


**111**
**SECTION FIVE - INTERVIEWING CHILDREN**


**Introduction**
Interviewing in households with children poses a special challenge for
interviewers, particularly when the interviewer needs to talk with the
children one at a time in a quiet setting away from the rest of the
household. While there is no guaranteed way to make every interview go
completely smoothly, there are several tricks you can use to increase the
chances that this will be a fun and pleasurable experience for you, the
children, and the rest of the household.


**Tell Primary Caregiver** Let the primary caregiver know what you will be doing and what you
**What You** **will** **be** will need when you make the appointment.
**Doing**

This is probably the most important and useful thing you can do - tell the
primary caregiver that you will need to interview each child one at a time in
a quiet place away from any distractions and other people in the household.
Enlist the primary caregiver' s support in finding a suitable place to do the
interview and assessments, and in setting up the interview times so that, for
example, you schedule the interview so you can work with the 5 year old
when the 3 year old sibling is napping.


Spend a little time talking with the primary caregiver and let (her/him)
know what the testing is all about. Tell (her/him) that if (she/he) helps the
child or interrupts the testing, you will have to code that answer as wrong
and the child will not get as accurate a score. Everyone knows that their
own child is exceptional and it is natural for parents to want to be in the
room while their children are being tested. If possible, ask the primary
caregiver to let you interview the child in private to make sure the child can
focus completely on the test. Always leave the door to this room slightly
ajar, have the child sit with his or her back to the door, and encourage the
primary caregiver to "peek in" frequently. This dispels any fears or
apprehensions that primary caregiver may have about letting their child be
in as a room alone with an unknown adult.



**Interview after meals**
**or naps rather than**
**just before**



Children are often cranky and less attentive when they are hungry or tired,
so try to avoid interviewing right before lunch time or nap time for young
children. Ask the primary caregiver about the household schedule and
suggest times for an interview that will help children be at their "best."


**112**
**SECTION FIVE • INTERVIEWING CHILDREN**


**Ask about household**
Because it is important that each child gets assessed, be sure to ask
**routine when setting** specifica **l** y about appointments the children may have (sports practice or
**up the interview** games, lessons, etc.) when you make the appointment. **If** one of the
children will only be in the household for a part of the time, you may need
to adjust the order in which you administer the individual interviews to
make sure that you complete the assessments, diaries and interviews for
each child.


**Other Children** You may want to take along a coloring book and crayons, or paper and
**Present** pencil to help keep children busy while their siblings get assessed. You
may have to be fairly direct with inquisitive children who are not being
tested. Give them a book to color or paper to draw on and ask them to go
in the other room until you are finished. **If** they are going to be tested later,
assure them that they will get their tum soon. Enlist the primary
caregiver's help if the situation becomes difficult.


**Be aware of the** TV and radio is a distraction to most people, but for some families it is on
**normal household** all the time and used for background noise. **If** that is the case, it may be
**routine**
best not to ask to have the TV turned off since the quiet may be more
distracting to the child than the "normal" TV.sounds. **If** the TV is on and
the child is trying to watch it while doing the test, ask to have the TV
turned off


**Talk with the children**
It is important for the children to feel at ease with the interviewer and the
**to get them** interview setting before starting the assessments. Some children will warm
**comfortable with you** up to you very quickly. Others will take a few minutes of chatting before
**before beginning the** they settle down. Ask the child questions about pets, favorite animals,
**assessment**
school, or favorite games or TV shows to get them talking about things
with which they are familiar.


**For very shy children,** **If** the young child is very shy (hiding behind the primary caregiver's legs
**let the primary** and obviously uncomfortable with strangers), you may need to test the
**caregiver stay in** child while (she/he) is sitting on the primary caregiver's lap. This is
**the rom** acceptable but you will need to ask the primary caregiver not to coach the
child in any way or try to help (him/her) with the test.


TOC


**Don't go into a room**

**alone with the child**



**SECTION FIVE- INTERVIEWING CHILDREN** 113


**PART B: ISSUES WITH CHILDREN**


**Although you need a quiet place to do the child assessment, do not go into**
**a room alone with a child and close the door. Leave the door part way**
**open and tell the primary caregiver that it is all right to "look in" at any**
**time. Also, try not to use the child's bedroom. The child's room will be**
**filled with (his/her) toys and belongings. The child will be easily distracted.**
**If, for any reason, the primary caregiver insists on being present, that is**
**acceptable. The primary caregiver must stand behind the child, out of**
**(his/her) view. The primary caregiver may not make any gestures or**
**noises. Explain to the primary caregiver that any reactions from (him/her)**
**will distract the child and negatively affect the assessment's accuracy.**



**Don't touch the child** **Do not touch the child for any reason at any time while you are in the**
**household. If necessary, enlist the primary caregiver's help for situations**
**such as repositioning the child.**



**Be neutral, don't**

**judge others' way of**

**life or parenting style**


**Pace yourself**


**If primary caregiver**
**asks to see the result**

**of the test**


**Suspected child**

**abuse**



**As with all interviews, it is important to leave your judgements at the door**
**when you enter a household. Sometimes this is more difficult to do when**
**children are involved since many people have very definite and strong**
**views about the right and wrong way to raise a child. It is important to be**
**accepting of everything in the household, even if it is not what you would**
**do with your own children.**


**You will be in the household for a long time, and testing children is one of**
**the most tiring and demanding types of interviewing there is. To keep**
**yourself from getting too fatigued, take a small break between interviews.**


**Primary caregivers often ask is how their child(ren) "did" on the test. The**
**tests will not be scored until they are returned to the central office, so you**
**will have to tell the caregiver that you do not have the results of the test.**
**Let them know that we will not have individual data available but,they** tie
**we will send the results of our study when our final data are available (in 1-**
**2 years).**


**If you see what you believe to be child abuse, report it to your Team**
**Leader. If, for any reason, you do not fel comfortable with that you can**
**contact_:, the Child Development Supplement Project Manager.**

threaten the parents with being reported or do anything in the interview
situation that would lead the parent to believe that their confidentiality is
being threatened. Remember that we have signed a confidentiality pledge
that protects the information that they give us.


If a situation escalates to physical violence while you are in the house,
excuse yourself and leave the home. Do not put yourself at risk at anytime
during the interview. You should also .run comment to the primary
caregiver about any action (slapping in the face, hitting, etc.) that occurs in
your presence. If you have any questions or concerns regarding an
interview, please call your Team Leader or-:, and we will do our
best to resolve the situation.

**Do not touch the child** It is important when measuring the height of the child, at the beginning of
the Primary Caregiver - Child Booklet, **not** to physically touch the child.
You will be provided a ruler that can be placed under a door jam or held
under your f **o** t. You can ask the child to stand next to the ruler (with
their shoes oft) while you record (his/her) height. Another option is to ask
the primary caregiver to measure the child for you and give you the
number. If the child refuses to be measured in either condition then ask the
primary caregiver to give you the child's height when they were last
measured, or their own best estimate.

Before interviewing the child, you wi **l** need to get written pemrission from
the primary caregiver. The permission form must be signed by a parent or
legal guardian of each selected child. The top white copy is for the records
in A **n** Arbor and the bottom yellow copy is for the primary caregiver to
keep. You do not need to get a signed permission form for children aged
0-2, since they will not be assessed or interviewed.


Even if we cannot get a signed parental permission form, we will still be
able to include the household in the study. The child data, however, is a
fundamental part of this study, so it is important to be as persuasive as
possible. Stress to the respondent the importance of the study and remain
positive in your introduction. Remember that parents love to talk about
their kids, so even though this interview is long, most people find it quite
enjoyable.


This study is attempting to collect information from all the sources that
influence children's development. The school questionnaires tell us about
the school environment and about the teacher's perception of the child.


If a primary caregiver is reluctant to sign the permission form, try gentle
persuasion by explaining how important this study is. Sometimes showing
the primary caregiver the school questionnaires will ease (his/her) concerns.
The primary caregiver always has a right to see these before signing the
pemrission form, so keep a set of school and daycare questionnaires in your
packet when you visit households.


It is impor **t** an that you fill out all parts of the permission form. If we do
not receive the questionnaires from the teacher and/or administrator we
will be following up with them. In order to do so accurately, we need full
information from you.


The teacher pemrission form is on three ply carbon paper. The white copy
is sent to the teacher. The yellow copy is sent to A **n** Arbor with your
completed household questionnaires and the pink copy is left with the
primary caregiver. The administrators do not receive a copy of the
pemrission form because there are no child specific questions in the
administrator questionnaires.

**following pages, you will be provided with a detailed description of these**
**tasks and the procedures for administering them.**


**The January trainig sessions and the practice session you conduct when**
**you return home will help you learn the basic procedures for this study.**
**You will receive your bulk supplies (see the Field Notes section of this**
**manual) by the middle of February. You will want to set up a system for**
**organizing your study materials so you can easily prepare each case as you**
**receive sample lines from Ann Arbor. As one model, the boxes on your**
**tables during training contained study materials in hanging file folder that**
**were ordered as follows:**


**Hanging Folder One:** **Accordion Files, Tan Materials Checklist,**
**Blank Coversheets**


**Hanging Folder Two:** **HH Cover Letter, Brochures, Time Diaries**

**You will receive each family case in an envelope sent from An Arbor.**
**The envelope will contain a household information sheet, CSMS checklist,**
**household coversheet, (if applicable, father out of home coversheet), and a**
**sheet of labels. You will review the household information sheet and**
**CSMS checklist to learn information about the family. You should verify**
**that the children names on these two forms, the coversheet(s), and the**
**sheet of labels all match.**


**120** **SECTION SIX - ADMINISTERING THE OVERALL PROCESS**


**Prepare Materials** Your bulk supplies include accordion files. You will put materials
**For The Case** into the accordion files so you are prepared to begin working with the
family. The steps to prepare the accordion files are given, below.


You will be sent a complete set of labels for every child. You will need to
determine which labels to use and place the appropriate one on materials
and questionnaires. An example of a label sheet is shown on the following
page. There are notes on labels to indicate where they belong. For
example, the sample label that should be placed on the back cover of one of
the Time Dairies says ''PEACH **WEEKDAY** DIARY **(A)."** (Note:
There are no such notes on the "Child Name" labels found at the bottom of
the label sheet. These labels are placed inside the front cover of booklets
that will be mailed or handed to respondents. You will find a box for these
labels on the inside front cover of the Time Diaries **(A),** and the "Child"
booklets given to the Other Caregiver (H) as well as the Home based Care
**(M)** or Preschool/Daycare Provider (L), or Teacher **(K).)**


Before you begin, put a label on the accordion file folder and on the tan
"Materials Checklist." Place the materials checklist, the household
information sheet, the CSMS check list and the Coversheet into the
accordion file. Then follow steps 1 through 8:


�- Put materials for the household precontact packet into the
according file, including:


               A Household Introduction Letter with the primary caregiver' s name
and the selected child(ren)'s name(s) filled out. (You will add the
interview time and date after you contact the primary caregiver.)

               - Two child time diaries (Booklet **A)** per child with the child's first
name and selected diary day on each time diary. (You will need to
add sample ID labels on the back cover and "Child Name" labels
inside the front cover.)

               - A study brochure to answer any of the respondent's questions
before you arrive at the household.

               A white UM Seal envelope. (The label in the top right hand corner
of the label sheet has the name, if available, and the address of a
person who **might** be the Primary Caregiver. Later, when you call
the household, if you verify this name and address are correct, you
can place this on the envelope. Otherwise, you will hand write the
name and address of the primary caregiver on the envelope.)


~~Step 2~~ . Fill in the appropriate blank lines and then place the parent
permission form in the accordion file.


**SECTION SIX • ADMINISTERING THE OVERALL PROCESS** **121**


~~Step 3~~ . [Label the Questionnaire Booklets< ] **[B, C, D, F, G, H ]** [> and place ]
them in the accordion file. You also need the Primary Caregiver
Respondent booklet (E) and the yellow cue card that accompanies the
Respondent booklet.


~~Step 4.~~ [Fill in the appropriate blank lines and then place the teacher ]
permission form into the accordion file.


~~Ste 5.~~ p [Put the teacher/preschool precontact letter that you expect is most ]
likely to apply in the accordion file. You will probably want to wait to
add labels but put a copy of the Questionnaire Booklet < K, **L, M**   expect is likely to apply in the accordion file.


~~Ste 6.~~ p [Put the administrator precontact letter you expect is most likely to ]
apply in the accordion file. Add a copy of the Questionnaire Booklet
< N, 0 > you expect is likely to apply.


~~Ste 7.~~ p [If applicable, fill in the appropriate blank lines on the father out of ]
the home precontact letter. Put labels on Questionnaire Booklets
< I, **J** >. Place the letter and the booklets in the accordion file.


~~Step 8.~~ Add [a respondent receipt and a self addressed/prepaid postage ]
envelope that the other caregiver can you to mail in questionnaires, if
needed.


Please **shred** any labels that you do not use, to ensure our respondents'
confidentiality.


It is possible that you would arrive at a household and need materials that
you had not put into the accordion file. We highly recommend that you
prepare a "backup accordion file" that contains copies of all the materials
listed above plus additional items such as respondent report forms,
respondent receipts, and other similar items.

The Household Coversheet includes Items 1 through 22 that need to be
answered when you call the household to set up an appointment for your
interviews. (You· can review these items in section two of this manual.)
The key things you will do during this call include:


Identify yourself and the study.

Determine who is the primary caregiver and if applicable, who is the
other caregiver.

Describe the household interview session including expected length.

Verify the address and indicate that you will send a packet in the mail.

Explain Time Diaries. (It is very important that you fully explain the
time diary over the phone to the primary caregiver. It will save you
a lot of time and hassle if the time diaries are correctly completed
for the selected days when you arrive at the household.)

Set an appointment for the household session.


When you visit the household for the interviews, you will take your
blue bag with the following items:


Accordion file with materials for this case.

- Woodcock Johnson Easel

Extra time diaries (2 per child)- for in-person interviewing, if necessary.

- Tape measure

Bag of Child incentives ( one per child + fuzzy bear stickers for siblings)

"Back-up" Materials Accordion File

Multiple pencils (for you and the different respondents)


Upon arriving, you will want to review with the primary caregiver the
activities you will carry out while visiting the household. These are listed,
below, in the preferred order:


1. Obtain signatures on the parent permission form( s) and mark this on
item 23 of the coversheet.


2. Give the other caregiver the two self administered questionnaires
<G,H>


3. Give the primary caregiver the household self administered
questionnaire < F >


4. Administer the Child Interview( s) using booklets < B > and < C > and
provide the child incentive. (These include the Woodcock Johnson
assessment.)


**124** **SECTION SIX - ADMINISTERING THE OVERALL PROCESS**


**5. Administer the Primary Caregiver Interview(s) using boklets< D >**
**and< E >. (These include the Woodcock Johnson assessment and**
**the measurement of the child's height.)**


**6. Review or, if needed, administer an interview to obtain correct**
**information for the Time Diaries < A >.**


**7. Retrieve the primary caregiver self administered household boklet**
**<F>.**


**8. Retrieve the other caregiver self adminstered boklets< G, H >, or if**
**needed, leave a self addressed/prepaid postage envelope for these.**


**9. Complete items RI through R19 on the coversheet, including:**
**If needed, update the address**
**Obtain contact information**
**Obtain information about the preschool or school for each child**
**Obtain a signature on the Teacher permission form**
**If applicable, obtain information about the Father Outside the Home**


**10. Thank the respondent and Indicate that a check will be sent (unless**
**cash is being paid at the house).**



**Edit Booklets and**
**Report Progress in**

**CSMS**



**As soon as possible after the household visit, edit all the materials from**
**the household session. As each is finalized, input the correct value code**
**into CSMS and transmit this information.**


**The purpose of editing is to make sure that the data you recorded in the**
**questionnaire and coversheet are clear to the coders and the study director.**
**When you edit, remember that someone who was not present when you**
**took the interview needs to understand the written answers.**


**Take adequate time to review the questionnaire and make sure that the**
**recorded information will make sense to the coder. If you realize that you**
**have missed a question or there is a conflict, call back immediately. It is**
**better to call the respondent back imediately, while the interview is still**
**fresh in the respondent's mind.**


**There are some general tips that you can keep in mind while editing.**
**Additionally, there is an Edit Checklist that gives you specific instructions**
**about editing the specific instruments you've administered. A copy of the**
**Editing Checklist is provided in Appendix I.**


**General Tips - Please check that:**
**-All entries are legible.**

H ~~o~~ m ~~e~~ - ~~Based Ca.~~ re A home-based care provider includes three types of
caregivers:
1) Family day care provider. This caregiver provides care for a
small group of children in the caregiver' s home.
2) In-home day care provider. This is a non-relative who provides
care in the target child's family home. The most usual case of
an in-home day care provider is a babysitter. It can also be a
babysitter or au pair.
3) Relative caregiver. This is a relative that provides care for the
target child in either the relative's home or the target child's
family home.


The key feature of home-based care is that it takes place in a residential
home. The home-based care provider will not fill out an administrator
questionnaire.


The home based care teacher mailing includes:

Home-Based care introduction Letter

Home-Based Care Questionnaire

- Brochure

White copy of teacher permission form

- Tyvek envelope with FO address

There is no administrator mailing for home based care.

**SECTION SEVEN - FIELD NOTES**


**PART A: FIELD INTERVIEWER EXPECTATIONS**



**Make Contact Early**


**Complete HH Cases**

**Within 3 Weeks**


**Response Rates**



**Because we are trying to finish up as many child households as possible**
**before schools get out in the summer, it is important to make contact with**
**households as soon as possible after receiving the coversheet from** Ann
**Arbor. You will need to balance your PSID and Child Development work**
**so that progress is made on both studies, and the teams meet their**
**production goals.**


**Another consideration to keep in mind as you schedule your contacts with**
**households is that all interviews for a household should be completed**
**within a 3-week time period. This means that if you have to collect a**
**household's interviews in multiple visits or phone calls, you should have**
**the entire set of household interviews completed within a 3-week period**
**after the first interview is done.**


**Ideally you will take all the interviews in a household in one visit, so this**
**will not be a problem. We recognize that this will not be possible for**
**everyone (especially some 2-child households). If you have several child**
**households in progress (with some but not all of the interviews completed),**
**the priority should be on finishing up the partially-done households rather**
**than starting more. This will be especially important in May, when we will**
**focus on finishing all Child households in progress before June 1.**


**We are expecting high response rates for this study because our families**
**have already agreed to do the PSID interview, and because parents love to**
**talk about their kids. Response rates tend to be highest on subject matters**
**that respondents care about, and this is a very salient topic to our**
**respondents. Our expected response rates are:**


- **90% of the families that complete a 1997 PSID interview will**
**participate in the Child Development Supplement.**


**Of those households that agree to participate in the Child Development**
**Supplement, the following is the response rate expected by each**
**respondent category:**


- **98% of the primary caregivers who agree to do the Child Development**
**Supplement will give us permission to interview their child(ren)**


- **85% of the eligible other caregivers will return their questionnaires.**


- **50% of the fathers outside the home will be interviewed (this is low**
**because some primary caregivers will not know where the father is)**


**13 2**
**SECTION SEVEN - FIELD NOTES**


**Hours per** HH **Case** **We expect that on average each household case will take about** 12 **hours.**
**This includes all components of the household case as well as**
**administrative time and reporting time. When you have completed all of**
**your cases, you should be able to take your total time spent on this study**
**and divide it by the total number of completed household cases and have it**
**be equal or less than** 12 **hours.**


**Employment** **Appendix K has a copy of the Employment Commitment Statement for**
**Commitment**
**your reference.**


**Study Timeline** **You can begin your first household case as soon as you receive it on**
**CSMS and in the mail, which will probably be mid-February. Production**
**will last through the end of May. Our study depends heavily on teacher**
**input, so we are stop interviewing during the school summer break months**
**of June, July, and August. All of your households due to be completed**
**before the break should be completed before the end of May. No teacher**
**mailings will be sent out between June 1 and September 1. Production**
**starts up again in the beginning of September and will continue until the**
**cases are completed. All cases should be completed by mid-November.**

to review. Reporting time can be spent planning steps to be taken for
specific cases, discussing refusals, tracking strategies, discussing ways to
meet the overall goals of the study, and applauding your accomplishments.
To make the most efficient use of your report time, have all your materials
and questions ready before the call. Consider your Team Leader and
Regional Manager as a guide and a resource for this study.


Regional Field Managers and Team Leaders need to monitor the quality of
the interviews and coversheets so that they can identify problems early.
Feedback will be given to you quickly and will let you know your strengths
as well as areas needing improvement.


Let your Regional Field Manager know when you have finished your
assignment. You can also tell him or her if you are interested in taking
additional household cases Instructions regarding the return of study
specific materials will be sent to you at the end of the study.

**PART C: INCENTIVES**


**Household Incentive** **The primary caregiver will receive a $25. 00 check once the interviewer**

**administered pieces of the household case are completed. If the other**
**caregiver interview is not completed, the primary caregiver will still receive**
**(his/her) incentive as long as the primary caregiver interview has been**
**completed. The check will be sent from Ann Arbor once the set of**
**completed household interviews has been received. If you pay the**
**respondent in cash, please check the correct box on the front of the grey**
**household coversheet. · Make sure you fill out the green respondent receipt**
**and have the primary caregiver sign it so that you will be reimbursed for**
**the expense. If there are problems with sending the primary caregiver the**
**respondent payment check (e.g., the check should be mailed to an address**
**other than that in CSMS), fill out a Respondent Payment Problem Form**
**(See Appendix L) and other arrangements will be made. Any further**
**questions or problems can be directed to-· at**
**When filling out Respondent Payment Problem Forms, Child Development**
**Supplement Form and not the PSID form.**

**Father Outside of**

**the Home Incentive**



**Any child that completes a child interview can receive a small toy. The**
**primary caregiver should always be asked if it is allowable that the child**
**receives a toy and can view all the toys before the child sees them. When**
**presenting the child with the choice of toys, it is best to narrow it down to**
**just a few. If it becomes a problem with other children in the house that**
**did not receive toys, you may give them UM bear stickers. The toys**
**should always remain a gift for the child completing our interview, and not**
**a gift to all the children in the household. All the toys are safe for children**
**over three years of age.**


**Any teacher or child care provider that mails back a completed**
**questionnaire will receive a $20.00 check from An Arbor.**


**Administrators do not receive an incentive for completing and mailing**
**back their questionnaires. The administrator questionnaire is short, and a**
**relatively low burden for them since there are no child-specific questions.**


**Any father outside of the home that completes an interview will receive a**
**$20. 00 check from Ann Arbor. The check will be mailed to the father as**
**soon as his questionnaires are received in Ann Arbor.**

**Request Form**
**Instructions**



**SECTION SEVEN - FIELD NOTES** **13 5**


**PART D: PERSUASION LETTERS**


When you contact a respondent and (she/he) expresses reluctance to be
interviewed, keep the following in mind:


✓Actively listen for reasons why (she/he) does not want to participate.


✓Try to respond to the respondent's concerns. We go to great lengths to
accommodate our respondents.


✓Always end your conversation graciously--but keep the door open: "I'll
give you some time to think it over and give you another call in a
couple weeks."


If your initial persuasion fails, assign the case a _**Resistance**_ status code and
complete a Persuasion Letter Request Form.


Although persuasion letters can be a useful tool in the refusal conversion
process, personal contact and discussion with the respondents, giving them
immediate response to their concerns, is always better.


The staff who write the persuasion letters do not have access to your
coversheets. We try, however, to tailor every letter to the individual
situation so we need all the information the forms ask for and any other
relevant details. Your complete description will be the key to an effective
letter. Here are the guidelines for requesting a letter: (A copy of the
Persuasion Letter Request Form is in Appendix G.)


**General Procedures:**


In ~~te~~ rvi ~~e~~ w ~~er~~


1. Once you determine you need to request a letter, gather all the
information needed, using the Persuasion Letter Request Form as your
guide. Be sure to have complete address information available when
you call your Team Leader.


2. Call your Team Leader, and relay the information to (him/her).

**Phase Code** I **for the time you spend in training, reviewing materials and**
**the application, and conducting your practice interview. Use Study Phase**
**Code** I **when you begin production.**


**Only coversheets finalized as an interview should be tallied in the X**
**production column on your TEJ. It is very important to our accounting**
**system that you report each completed interview in the correct X**
**production unit column as you complete it. Do not report production units**
**for partially completed interviews. Each production unit reported carries a**
**supply allowance value of $0.20. That amount will be included in your**
**expense check for each interview reported during any pay period. There**
**will be no Y production units.**

**FON Cards**



**SECTION SEVEN - FIELD NOTES** **13 9**


Information on how to handle households that need translations and study
aides will be sent to you in the coming weeks. Along with these
instructions will be Spanish versions of the questionnaires for interviewers
who will be interviewing in Spanish. If you have any questions regarding
this in the meantime, please contact your Team Leader.


The Ann Arbor Office has a corporate account with Sprint, and
interviewers can be issued Sprint FON Cards. These cards can be used in
most parts of the country. This system consolidates all of your FON card
usage into one account that will be billed to the Ann Arbor office. Enter
the- Child Development Supplement project number-when
making long distance calls for this study. When making calls that do not
use the SPRINT system, follow the normal TEI reporting procedures. If
you do not have a FON card or lose your FON card, please notify **1111**

- in the Ann Arbor office.

**Closed Questions**

**Options in**

**Parentheses**



Closed questions contain the response categories as a part of the question.
For these questions, mark an "X'' through the box containing the
respondent's answer, or write in the respondent's answer in the "other"
category.


Open-ended questions are used when a full expression of opinion is
desired. The respondents' answers to open-ended questions are entered in
the questionnaire word for word. All open-ended questions mYfil be
probed with "any others" (AO) unless there are instructions not to do so in
the questionnaire or in the QxQs.


Key words in the questionnaire are undeined.rl Emphasize these words
when you are reading the question.


If the question sequence varies depending on the respondent's answer to a
particular question, arrows or **skip instructions** are used to tell the
interviewer which question to ask next. Follow the arrows or skip
instructions where they occur in the questionnaire. If no skip is indicated,
read the next question.


Interviewer **checkpoints** are also used to route the interviewer to the next
appropriate question. Checkpoints are used when the routing information
comes from the coversheet or an answer earlier in the questionnaire. Mark
the correct option with an "X'' through the box and proceed to the next
designated question.


Sometimes there will be a **choice** of terms or phrases to use in a question
(also called "fills"). Whenever there is a choice of wording, the options
will be set off in parentheses with a slash separating the choices, e.g.,
(his/her) or child(ren). You will know which option to read based on
information in the coversheet or previous questions.


**141**
**SECTION SEVEN - FIELD NOTES**


**Words** **in** **All Capitals** Words in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS should **not** be read to the respondent.

There are three reasons for putting words in all capitals:


l. Instructions to the interviewer (e.g., skip instructions)
2. Boxed response categories
3. Indication to substitute a word or name, e.g., you should read the
child's name when (CHILD) appears in the questionnaire.


Response categories in boxes are not to be read to the respondent unless
there is a specific instruction to do so at the question or in the QxQs. Only
words in lower case should be read to respondents.

**Digressions**

Some respondents will digress from the topic and talk about subjects that
have no bearing on the study objectives. Long, irrelevant discourses may
be omitted from the recorded interview if you are certain that what the
respondent said� nm contribute to fulfilling the objectives of the study.


Note a digression by entering DIG in the margin of the questionnaire,
right where the digression occurred in the interview. When a respondent
is digressing, do not give feedback to encourage the irrelevant remarks.
Look for a break where you can get the respondent back to the
questionnaire as quickly as possible.


Fill in the "other" category where necessary in closed questions. Some
closed questions include a provision for an "other **'** category separate from
the fixed responses in the boxes. If the respondent's answer does not fit
into one of the precoded categories, mark the "other" box and specify the
answer. Please refer to the QxQs for further instruction about "other"
category responses.


Do not erase any markings in the questionnaire. If a word is illegible,
make a marginal note to clarify it while you are editing. Use an arrow
to show an answer change made by the respondent. If the respondent
~~c~~ han ~~ies~~ [an answer more than once, number the arrows so the coders ]
know the sequence of events and the final answer.


If you mistakenly mark an incorrect answer box, mark the correct box
and include an arrow and note [iwer error].


Do not erase any calculations you have made in the margin, because it is
often useful to know how you and the respondent arrived at figures for
rent, income, days of vacation, etc.


**14 2**
**SECTION SEVEN - FIELD NOTES**


**Use a pencil to record data. Use a number 2 black lead pencil to enter**
**the respondent's answers; a harder lead keeps its point longer but gives a**
**faint impression, which is difficult for the coders to read. Keep several**
**pencils with you so that you always will have a sharp one. Do not use a**

**pen.**


**Write legibly. Regardless of how good the actual interview may have**
**been, it will be worthless if your recording of it cannot be read. When**
**you edit an interview, check to be sure that all of your writing is legible.**


**Enter responses during the interview. Begin recording answers as soon as**
**the respondent starts speaking. Use abbreviations where necessary. Be**
**sure to replace all nonstandard abbreviations when editing the interview.**



**Interviewer**
**Parentheses**



**Use parentheses ( ) or slashes / / to distinguish clearly between the**
**respondent's words and anything you say or do. Do not put anything the**
**respondent says in parentheses. It is assumed that anything not in**
**parentheses is in the respondent's own words, so it is not necessary to**
**use quotation marks. Please make sure that any incomplete verbatim**
**answer will make sense to the coders by including explanatory notes in**
**brackets in the margin.**



**Interviewer Brackets** **Use brackets [] for comments you wish to make to the coders and**
**analysts, such as descriptions of respondent behavior, summaries of**
**respondent digressions, or cross references and marginal notes.**


**Time stamps** **If you must end an interview in the middle of a questionnaire, record the**
**time stopped at the exact point where you stop. When you start the**
**booklet, at a later date, record the time began again and the time the**
**booklet is completed. Add the two times together to get the time for the**
**entire questionnaire. Stopping an interview in the middle of a**
**questionnaire should only be used as a last resort. It is much better to do**
**just one questionnaire and come back for another than to do one**
**questionnaire and part of as a second.**

DEFINITIONS OF RESPONDENTS

_**1997**_ _**P**_ _**S**_ _**I**_ _**D Child Development Supplement**_
_**Respondent Definitions**_


**Primary Caregiver:**


**You will determine the primary caregiver when you contact the family. You will have a**
**good idea of who this person is from the household information sheet you receive from Ann**
**Arbor. On this sheet, every member of the PSID Household will be listed as well as their PSID**
**sequence numbers. The Primary Caregiver must be a member of the Household Unit. You will**
**choose who best fits the title Primary Caregiver. This is determined by the person's relationship**
**to the target child.**


**By preference, the list is as follows:**


**1)** **Mother (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster) or PSID "wife"**


**2)** **Father (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster).**


**3** **[)]** **Legal Guardian of the target child**


**4)** **Final preference is to take the interview from the person living in the HU unit**
**who is an adult ( over 18 years of age) and takes primary responsibility for caring for the child.**
**This does not include someone who is paid or hired to take care of the child (i.e. not a babysitter**
**or nanny).**


**It can be determined whether there is a biological mother or father in the Household Unit**
**by looking at the child line on the Household Information Sheet. If the child line lists a Mother**
**Sequence Number or a Father Sequence Number then the person listed under the household**
**listing with that number is that child's biological mother or father. Note that while the target child**
**is selected from the PSID Family Unit, the Primary Caregiver is selected from the Household**
**Unit. Also, while preference 3 and 4 in the primary caregiver definition have to be over age 18,**
**the mother or father (preference 1 or 2) can be under 18. It also is possible to have more than 1**
**primary caregivers in a Household Unit. An example of this would be if two sisters were living**
**together and both had their own children. In this case we interview both primary caregivers in**
**regards to their own children.**


**Other Caregiver:**


**You will also determine the who is the Other Caregiver once you have contacted the**
**family. Again, you will have a good idea of who this is from the Household Information Sheet**
**that is sent from Ann Arbor. As with the Primary Caregiver, you will select the person from a list**
**by order of preference. The Other Caregiver must be living in the Household Unit. Please note**
**that once someone is a selected as the Primary Caregiver he/she can be selected as another**


**respondent as well. An example would be if the there were two sisters living together each with**
**their own child. They would both be primary caregivers to their own children and other**
**caregivers to their sister's children if there was no one else in the household unit that better fit that**
**description. The order of preference is listed below.**


**The order of preference for the Other Caregiver is as follows:**


**1)** **Father (Biological, Adoptive, Step, or Foster)**


**2)** **Grandmother of the target child**


**3** **[)]** **Boyfriend or Girlfriend of the primary caregiver**


**4)** **Other Relative of child who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in the HU.**
**If there is more than one in the HU, choose the person who has the most responsibility for taking**
**care of the target child**


**5)** **Other Non-relative who is an adult (over 18 years old) and living in the HU. If**
**there is more than one in the HU, choose the person who has the most responsibility for taking**
**care of the target child. This should not be a paid employee (i.e. not a babysitter or nanny).**


**As with the Primary Caregiver, it can be determined whether there is a biological father in**
**the Household Unit by looking at the child line on the Household Information Sheet. If the child**
**line lists a Father Sequence Number then the person listed under the household listing with that**
**number is that child's biological father. Note that, as with the Primary Caregiver, while the target**
**child is selected from the PSID Family Unit, the Primary Caregiver is selected from the Household**
**Unit. Again, if there are two different primary caregivers, we could have two different partners.**
**Unlike preference 1 and 2 for primary caregiver, all the definitions of Other Caregiver must be**
**over 18 years of age.**

PERSUASION AND REFUSAL CONVERSION


154


**Persuasion**

**Techniques**


u


**e**


**n**



**155**


Persuasion techniques are important in order to avoid refusals.


  - Be confident, courteous, assertive--but not aggressive. Take
pride in your work and your association with The University
of Michigan-Survey Research Center. Build your knowledge
of the study in order to build your self-confidence. Maintain
professionalism; develop your own style.


  - Have a very smooth introduction; do not pause or hesitate.


    - Know all about the study you are working on and be
ready to answer all ~~qest~~ u ions. Don't be caught off guard!

    - ST ART simply - the person you are speaking with will
ask for more information if they want it. Try to speak to
the R's concerns. Don't speak "down" to the
Respondents or "over" their heads.

   - **SLOW DOWN**    - and use words in your explanations that
are easily understood.

   - Do not wait for signs of approval or "O.K., go ahead"
from people. Do the necessary screening and verification
and get on with the interview.


  - Listen carefully - you cannot respond to people's reaction to
you if you don't listen carefully to inflections in their voices
(including pace), and the f **e** dback they give you while you
are answering their questions.


    - Person-to-Person - added advantage of seeing expressions,
body language. USE EYE CONTACT.


  - Do not ask questions that can be answered with a yes or no;
e.g., "Is now a good time for you?"; "Can we go ahead?".
They'll let you know if it's not. Instead - "I am so happy I
caught you at home - I've been looking forward to talking
with you", etc.


  - Always explain all about yourself and the study to anyone in
the household - don't wait until you are speaking with R.
They may help convince R that the interview is important.


  - When making appointments, give R or the informant choices

    - rather than yes or no questions. "Are mor **n** igs or
afternoons better?" "Do you have more time in the evening
or on weekends?"


**156**


**w:p**


**Refusal**
**Conversions (RC's)**




**•** **Be so well prepared that there is nothing R can say that will**
~~**sr**~~ **w:p** **i** ~~**s**~~ **[e]** ™· **Anticipate common Respondent comments and**
**questions, and write out explanations in your own words.**
**You must offer a solution to any excuse or concern.**


**•** **Try not to push to a refusal - leave the door open or take a**
**refusal and call back.**


**•** **Call notes and appointment notes are essential.**


**•** **Approach each RC individually and address directly the**
**unique problem.**

**•** **You must reconstruct in your own mind the questions and**
**answers given and the surroundings in order to avoid**
**another refusal.**

**•** **Have a "game plan" or opening for each RC you do.**


**•** **Suggest times to try RC's if time allows.**


**•** **Do not try at time of refusal.**

**•** **Try the elderly or hard of hearing in the mornig.**

**•** **People with infants or very small children - early**
**afternoon during naps or early evening when someone else**
**may be around to help with the children.**

**•** **Working people - evenings or weekends are the best**
**times.**

**•** **Young adults - between 10 am and 12 noon Saturday or**
**Sunday before ball games, etc.**


**•** **Find an opening statement for each interview that will hold**
**the attention of the person.**


**•** **"I stopped by before and caught you at a bad time."**

**•** **"I know you told me not to stop in again, but I was in the**
**neighborhood ... "**

**•** **"I know you said you didn't want to do the interview and**
**I am sorry, but we need your help ...** fl

**•** **"I know you said you were not interested but I did want to**
**explain more about the study. Your thoughts and**
**opinions are very important to us.** fl


**•** **Address all - "I know you told me" before they say "I TOLD**
**YOU ... " Acknowledge that you heard what they said during**
**the refusal.**


**157**

**•** **Listen CAREFULLY and be able to �** ~~ifraton.~~
n o m i

**Always answer all questions and don't try to bulldoze anyone**
**into the interview. It won't work.**


**• Address emotions -**


**•** **"You frightened my mother."**

**•** **"I was very angry the last time.** 11


**•** **Give a lot of reassurance. Examples:**


**•** **"No right or wrong answers"**

**•** **"We want your thoughts and opinions"**

**•** **"We are not selling anything"**

**•** **"You are important to our study** 11

**•** **"We need your help"**

**•** **Explain about your job. "rll read questions to you and**
**then write down the answers ... "**


**•** **Stay professional and non-threatening.**


**Refusal Conversion** - **I stopped by before and caught you at a bad time.**
**Opening Sentences**

**• I'm stopping by to apologize for any misunderstanding.**


**•** **rm stopping by for two reasons: First, because you are very**
**important to our study and we do want to interview you; and**
**second, because I want to be able to answer any questions**
**you may have about our study.**


**• I'm stopping by again because we need your help.**


**•** **I'm sure you're wondering why I'm stopping by.**

**• "This particular (household/telephone number) was**
**scientifically selected to represent many other households.**
~~**Noody can re**~~ **b** ~~**la**~~ **p** ~~**yo**~~ **ce** **u** **in this study. If we cannot interview**

University of Michigan. The Institute was established OVER
40 years ago, and today is the largest university based
academic social research institution in the world."


- "The Survey Research Center conducts studies that are
important to society and contribute to scholarly knowledge

do the interview at a convenient time for you. I could give
you a call at (suggest alternate days and times)."


- "I am sorry that you are not feeling well, how about if we
postpone this for awhile (a few days) and I'll give you a call
then ( or I' 11 give you our collect call number and you can call

**HOUSEHOLD INTRODUCTION LETTER**


**Spring, 1997**
**Dear** -----------

**Thank you for agreeing to participate in the Child Development Supplement study. This study will help**
**researchers learn how the nation's children are faring over time. This project is funded by the National**
**Institute of Child Health and Human Development to gather information on how financial and social**
**resources in the home, community and school affect children's health and achievement. We have**
**enclosed a brochure containing additional information about the study.**


**On the date recorded below, the interviewer you recently talked with will come to your home to**
**interview both you and your child/ren. The name of each child chosen for an interview is listed below. It**
**is important that each child listed is present on the day of the interview at the scheduled time. The**
**interview will take approximately one and a half hours per child. As part of this interview, the**
**interviewer will be administering a standard achievement assessment. We want to make sure that we are**
**able to test each child as accurately as possible. Because distractions tend to lower test scores, it would**
**be best if the interview could be done in a quiet place with as few distractions as possible.**


**The Time Diary your interviewer mentioned is enclosed with this letter. Please note that there are two**
**diaries for each child. Each diary should be completed on the day specified on the front cover. We**

**will pick them up at the time of your child's interview.**


**In appreciation for your participation in our study, we will be sending you a check for $25.00 and each**

**conducting a nation-wide study of approximately 3,000 children aged 0- 12. The purpose of the study is to help**
**researchers gain insight into how resources in the home, community and schools affect children's health and achievement.**
**This study, called the Child Development Supplement, is funded by both the National Institute of Child Health and**
**Human Development and the U.S. Department of Education. It is being conducted in conjunction with The Teacher's**
**College of Columbia University in New York. The study is also advised by a Board consisting of well-respected**
**educators and social scientists.**


**The student whose name appears on the enclosed Teacher Questionnaire is a member of one of the families that has been**

**attends your class and has given us permission to obtain information from you about his/her experiences and performance**
**at school. The signed permission form is enclosed with this letter. In order to develop a comprehensive picture of a**
**child's development, it is crucial to include his/her teacher's assessment. We appreciate your cooperation in filling out the**

**the information already provided by the family. The child has completed the "Woodcock-Johnson Educational**
**Assessment" and his/h� parents have participated in an extensive interview.**


**We would like to have the questionnaire completed by the teacher who has the student in his or her classroom for the**
**major portion of the day and who is most knowledgeable about this student's current school experience. If the**
**information is not current or you do not feel that you are the best teacher to complete the survey, please bring this to our**
**attention as soon as possible by calling the toll-free number indicated at the end of this letter.**


**It may be necessary for you to refer to your records in order to answer some of the questions. All information we gather is**
**confidential and will be used only in statistical summaries for research purposes. The survey has been approved by the**
**appropriate review boards at the University of Michigan and Columbia University.**


**Please complete the questionnaire this week, and return it to the University of Michigan in the enclosed pre-addressed,**
**stamped envelope. Upon receipt of your completed questionnaire, a check for $20.00 will be sent to you in appreciation**
**of the time you gave to our study.**
