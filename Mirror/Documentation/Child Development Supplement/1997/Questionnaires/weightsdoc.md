Description of the 1997 PSID Child Supplement Weights


October 27, 1999


1. Introduction.


The University of Michigan Survey Research Center’s Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is an
ongoing longitudinal survey of a representative sample of U.S. families. The study collects data on
employment, income, wealth, housing, food expenditures, transfer income, and marital and fertility
behavior. The PSID began in 1968 with a national sample of 5,000 families and had grown to include over
8,700 families in 1996 through the formation of new families by children or other sample members of the
original 5,000 families. Since no new families were incorporated, new entrants to the United States were
not included. The introduction of a national sample of post-1968 immigrants in 1997 (facilitated by a
reduction of the core sample) made the PSID sample representative of the U.S. population in 1997. The
1997 PSID Child Development Supplement is an addition to the PSID core data collection designed to
provide researchers with comprehensive nationally-representative data about children ages 0-12 and their
families. All respondents to the Child Supplement will have been included in the 1997 wave. The majority
of respondents will be from long-term PSID families. Others will be from the addition to the core PSID of
what we here call the "1997 PSID Immigrant sample." Although the 1997 PSID Child Development
Supplement is drawn primarily from the PSID Core families, the Child Supplement includes a group of
African-American families with children under age 13 in 1997 that are not included in the 1997 PSID
Core. Without these additional families, the Child Supplement family weights would be exactly the same
as the 1997 PSID Core family weights. [1]


In order to construct the family selection weight component for the Child Supplement, the effect of
the core reduction on the probabilities of selection for families in each of the six strata must be
considered. Table 1 shows the six parts which make up the 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement.
Families in Strata 1 and 5 used the 1996 PSID family weights as the preliminary 1997 family weights for
the core sample. These two groups were not affected by the 1997 PSID core reduction. Families in Strata
2, 3, and 4 had probabilities of being selected both into the SRC and SEO samples. In the 1997 core
reduction, only Black families from the original SEO sample had a chance of retention. Therefore, the
1997 family weights which reflected the joint probabilities of selection had to be recomputed to exclude
the SEO probability for non-Blacks and to adjust the SEO probability for Blacks. Families in Stratum 6 are
present only in the 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement. They are excluded from the 1997 PSID
Core and therefore do not have 1997 Core family weights.


2. Composition of the 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement.


The PSID consists of two separate samples--a nationally representative sample of U.S. families
designed by the University of Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) and an over sample of low
income, mostly African-American, families from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO). In 1997 the
full SRC sample was retained plus all the original African-American families from the low-income SEO
subsample with children under age 13 in 1997 and a subsample of families without children under 13, a
total of 6,792 families ~~.~~ [2] The analysis weights constructed for the Child Development Supplement are the
product of three factors: 1) a family selection weight which is the inverse of the family’s probability of
selection; 2) a post-stratification factor which adjusts the sample family totals to the 1997 CPS estimated
totals for forty-eight demographic/geographic cells; and 3) a within family selection weight which is the
inverse of the probability of selection of the child from the set of children age 0-12 in the family.


In order to construct the family selection weight component for the Child Supplement, the effect of
the core reduction on the probabilities of selection for families in each of the six strata must be


considered. Table 1 shows the six parts which make up the 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement.
Families in Strata 1 and 5 used the 1996 PSID family weights as the preliminary 1997 family weights for
the core sample. These two groups were not affected by the 1997 PSID core reduction ~~.~~ [3] Families in
Strata 2, 3, and 4 had probabilities of being selected both into the SRC and SEO samples. In the 1997 core
reduction, only Black families from the original SEO sample had a chance of retention. Therefore, the
1997 family weights which reflected the joint probabilities of selection had to be recomputed to exclude
the SEO probability for non-Blacks and to adjust the SEO probability for Blacks. Families in Stratum 6 are
present only in the 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement. They are excluded from the 1997 PSID
Core and therefore do not have 1997 Core family weights.

3. Weighting Adjustment to Integrate Samples and Create Initial Family Weight.


Most of the Child Supplement families from the 1997 PSID Core Sample and all of the Child
Supplement families from the 1997 PSID Immigrant sample had already been assigned family weights
which were calculated for the 1997 PSID Core (including the Immigrant) sample. However, cases from
Stratum 6 which are present only in the 1997 Child Supplement and not in the Core sample had values of
zero for the 1997 PSID Core family weight. In addition, cases which were part of the 1994 PSID
recontact effort also had values of zero for the 1997 Core family weight. These recontact cases have no
interview data from 1993 and prior years and are unusable for longitudinal analyses using the Core data
set, but are usable for the Child Development Supplement which began in 1997. Table 2 shows the
number of cases with zero and non-zero weights in each of the six strata.

1997 PSID Family Weight by Stratum.

|2. SRC Black sample overlapped with the SEO sample|56|5|51|
|3. SRC Non-Black sample overlapped with the SEO<br>sample|8|0|8|

|6. Supplementary sample for Black families with<br>children 0-12|507|507|0|

|Total PSID Child Development Supplement Sample|2380|600|1780|


As a first step in the assignment of family weights to the cases that had zero weights for the 1997 Core
family weight, sixteen weighting cells were formed by crossing the strata defined above (collapsed from
six to four) [5] by a two-category family type (two-parent or other) by a two category age of family head
(<30 or 30 and older). The algorithm used for assigning family weights to these &quotzero weight" cases
was initially to assign to them the mean weight of the cases in the weight domain cell to which they belong
and then to scale the sum of the weights in the weight domain cell back to the total of the original
non-zero weights. The total of the non-zero weights in the 1997 Core data set was matched to 1997 CPS
totals for the cells (in 000s). Table 3 shows the grouping of cases into weight domain cells and the sums of
the Core family weights in each domain. The Adjustment Factor was the factor used to scale back the
family weight of each case in the cell (both the positive weight cases and the cases which originally had
zero weights and were assigned weights equal to the cell means) so that the sum of weights in the cell was
equal to the 1997 Core family weight total.

4. Poststratification to 1997 CPS Totals.


The PSID Child Development Supplement famiies were assigned to forty-eight poststratification cells
formed by crossing the following four variables: (1) race of head (Non-Black / Black); (2) education level
of head (< high school graduation / high school graduation / some post-secondary education); (3) MSA
status (MSA / non-MSA); (4) Census Region (Northeast / Midwest / South / West). If there were fewer
than 15 families in a cell, adjacent cells were collapsed across the Census Region dimension.


Corresponding weighted totals for each poststratification cell were calculated for the PSID Child
Development Supplement families and for the 1997 CPS households ~~.~~ [7] The weight used for the PSID
Child Supplement totals was the adjusted family weight described in Part 3.

The 1997 CPS March Supplement household weight (divided by 1000) was used for the CPS totals.
Only CPS households which included a child 0 - 12 were included in the poststratification totals.
Poststratification factors were computed by dividing the CPS total by the PSID Child Supplement total for
each cell. Table 4 shows the poststratification cells, the number of Child Supplement families, the
weighted CPS total, the weighted Child Supplement total, and the poststratification factor.


5. Within Family Child Selection Weight Factor.


Interviewers collected data about each age-eligible child in the PSID Child Development Supplement
families up to a maximum of two children per family. If there were more than two age-eligible children in
a family, two children were selected using a random procedure. The probability of selection of a child is
the number of children selected divided by the number of eligible children in the family; and the within
family selection weight is the inverse of this probability. The denominator used to construct the PSID
child selection weight factor was the number of children interviewed in the family instead of the number
of children selected. This weight factor, therefore, incorporates a child-level nonresponse adjustment. For
example if there were three eligible children in the family and two were selected and one interviewed, the
nonresponse adjusted selection weight factor is 3/1 = 3.0. If both children were interviewed the selection
weight factor would be 3/2 = 1.5. Table 5 shows the distribution of PSID Child Development Supplement
families by the number of age eligible children and the number of children interviewed.

Children in 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement Families.

The final analysis weight (CH97PRWT) for child-level data is the product of the poststratified family selection
weight (CH97HHWT) and the nonresponse adjusted within family child selection weight factor (SUBSELWT). A
comparison of the weighted distribution of race by sex by age for children in the PSID Child Development Supplement
sample to the weighted distribution of race by sex by age in the 1997 CPS March Supplement (Table 6) shows that the
weighted PSID proportions match fairly closely to the CPS proportions. Therefore it was not necessary to poststratify
the person level weights.

6. Weights for Supplementary Questionnaire Data


The 1997 PSID Child Development Supplement collected reliable age-graded assessments
of the cognitive, behavioral, and health status of children age 0-12 from several sources
including the primary caregiver, a second caregiver, an absent parent, a teacher, a school
administrator, and the child. The Primary Caregiver is the main respondent and is usually the
child’s mother. If the mother is not living with the child, the primary caregiver could be the
father, legal guardian or person who knows most about the child’s activities. If the primary
caregiver was interviewed about two children, the interviewer filled out a separate
questionnaire for each child.


These Primary Caregiver/Child interviews form the core data collection of the
Supplement. In order to be included in the PSID Child Development Supplement data set,
data about the child must have been obtained from the primary caregiver. The response rate
for the primary caregiver interviews about each child was 88 percent. Response rates for the
auxiliary questionnaires were lower. For example, although the response rate for the Primary
Caregiver/Child interview was 88 percent, the response rate for the Primary Caregiver
completion of the household questionnaire was 63 percent. In order to construct weights for
analyzing these supplementary data sets, a nonresponse adjustment was constructed by
multiplying each weight by the ratio of the sum of weights for the total eligible by the sum of
weights for the total interviewed. This nonresponse adjustment was computed separately for
each poststratification cell (as defined in Table 4: race of head / education of head / MSA
status / and Census Region).


The following example shows how these weights were calculated. The poststratification


cell for Non-Black heads who did not complete high school and live in an MSA in the
Northeast has a weighted total of 658.138 for the total set of Primary Caregiver/Child
respondents. Of these, all were eligible to complete the Primary Caregiver household book,
but the weighted total for Primary Caregiver/Child respondents in this poststratification cell
who completed this questionnaire was 345.861. Therefore, the nonresponse adjustment factor
for the Primary Caregiver/Child weights in this cell was 658.138/345.861 = 1.903.


Not all Child Development Supplement families had Other Caregivers. The nonresponse
adjustments for the Other Caregiver weights were created by dividing the total weight for the
eligible cases in each poststratification cell by the total weight for the respondents. For
example, the weighted total for cases with an Other Caregiver in the cell which includes
Non-Black heads who did not complete high school and who live in an MSA in the Northeast
is 541.369. The weighted sum of Other Caregiver respondents in this cell is 300.362.
Therefore the nonresponse adjustment factor for this cell is 541.369/300.362 = 1.802.


Special weights were computed for the Primary Caregiver Household Book data
(PCGHHBWT), the Other Caregiver Child Book data (OTCGCHWT), and the Other
Caregiver Household Book data (OTCGHHWT). These weights, like the Primary
Caregiver/Child weight (CH97PRWT), should be used for analyses involving child-level data
or data involving the relationship of the child with a caregiver or with family characteristics.
The family level weight (CH97HHWT) should be used for analyses at the family level. The
special weights described above (PCGHHBWT, OTCGCHWT, and OTCGHHWT) can be
converted to family level weights by dividing them by the within family subselection weight
(SUBSELWT). Table 7 shows for each supplemental weight the weighted totals for eligible
and responding cases in each poststratification cell and the corresponding nonresponse
adjustment factor.


If an analysis requires both a primary and &quotother" caregiver for a child (i.e. only
children who have both a primary and other caregiver are included), the nonresponse
adjusted weight for the least often measured data type should be used. This would be the
Other Caregiver Child Book (OTCGCHWT) or the Other Caregiver Household Book
(OTCGHHWT) weight if data from the Household Booklet is used.


If an analysis uses the union of the data sets, a Primary Caregiver for single caregiver
families and both Primary and Other booklets when both primary and other caregivers are
present, a combined weight should be used. For primary caregiver only families, the weight
for the least often measured primary caregiver booklet type should be used. For children in
families with both a primary and other caregiver, the weight for the least often measured
other caregiver data type should be used.

ENDNOTES
1 The contruction of the 1997 PSID Family Weights is described in core documentation.


2 Retaining the SEO African-American families with children under 13 was made possible through special
supplemental funding from NICHD, the William T. Grant Foundation, and the Annie E. Casey


Foundation.


3
The effect of the 1997 PSID Core reduction on the 1997 PSID Core family weights is described in more
detail in core weights documentation.


4
These cases were interviewed only for the 1997 Child Development Supplement. They were not
interviewed for the 1997 Core, including Immigrant, samples and therefore were not assigned Core Family
weights.


5
The SRC/non-SEO group comes from Stratum 1; the SRC/SEO BLack group is made up of Strata 2, 4,
and 6; the SRC/SEO Non-Black group is frmo Stratum 3; and the 1997 Immigrant sample cases are from
Stratum 5.


6
The PSID weights are scaled to the 1997 CPS totals in thousands.


7
The CPS totals were divided by 1000 to correspond with the scale used for the PSID family weights.


8
Two families are excluded from this table because they resided outside of the United States.


9
Although the total number of cases was 3563, three of these were located outside the United States and
therefore were not included in the poststratification cells.
