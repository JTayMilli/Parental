# Chapter 1 _Overview of the Study_

## Summary

Between February 1996 and June 1998, the University of Michigan, Survey Research Center conducted
the 1997 Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The objective
of the project was to gather data that would provide researchers with comprehensive and nationally
representative information about children and their families to study how economic and social differences
affect child development.


The Child Development Supplement to the PSID obtained the following: (i) reliable, age graded
assessments of the cognitive, behavioral, and health status of 3,600 children (including about 250
immigrant children) obtained from the mother, a second parent or parent-figure, the teacher or child care
provider, and the child; (ii) a comprehensive accounting of parental and caregiver time inputs to children
as well as other aspects of the way children and adolescents spend their time; (iii) teacher-reported time
use in elementary and preschool programs; and (iv) other-than-time use measures of other resources--for
example, the learning environment in the home, teacher and administrator reports of school resources, and
parent-reported measures of neighborhood resources. Data were collected from 2,394 PSID families with
3,586 children aged twelve and under.

## Introduction


The PSID is the premier ongoing longitudinal survey of a representative sample of U.S. men, women,
children, and the families in which they reside. Data on employment, income, wealth, housing, food
expenditures, transfer income, and marital and fertility behavior have been collected annually since 1968.
From 5,000 families in 1968, the study had grown to include over 8,700 families in 1996, since children
and other sample members become respondents in their own right when they leave the original household.
In 1997, the PSID reduced the core sample and added a refresher sample of immigrants to the United
States (since 1968) so that the data are representative of the current U.S. population. As a result, in 1997
the core PSID sample consisted of 6,792 families. The study is conducted at the Survey Research Center,
Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan. Core funding is provided by the Economics and
Sociology programs of the National Science Foundation, with additional funding from the Department of
Health and Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, and the National Institute on
Aging.


One of the major uses of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in recent years has been to examine the
consequences of family events and circumstances such as family structure and income during the years
children are living with their parents for children's educational and economic successes as young adults
(Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, Klebanov & Sealand, 1993; Duncan, Brooks-Gunn & Klebanov, 1994; Duncan,
Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998; Haveman & Wolfe, 1994; McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994). Until
1997, data on family circumstances were collected annually from interviews with one adult respondent so,
for individuals in the sample under age 30, these family measures are available from birth for years they


are in the study. Once children turn age 12, information about their marital, fertility is obtained; at age 16,
labor force activities and income are obtained; and, once they form their own household, detailed
information on their own circumstances as young adults is obtained. However, the only information on
children as children had been limited to age, sex, and schooling. Therefore, we did not know the
childhood mechanisms or process whereby early family, school, and neighborhood experiences facilitate or
detract from leading a healthy, productive adult life. In 1995, funding from the Assistant Secretary of
Planning and Evaluation, Department of Health and Human Services, enabled the PSID to include a set of
questions asked of adults about their own and their young children's school successes, and failures. While
this was an important first step, the supplement was limited. It contained no direct assessments or reports
of children's development and experiences as children.


The Child Development Supplement to the PSID (PSID-CDS) rectified that situation. The additions to
information collection in the main PSID include the following: (i) reliable, age graded assessments of the
cognitive, behavioral, and health status of 3,600 children (including about 250 immigrant children),
obtained from the mother, a second parent or parent-figure, the teacher or child care provider, and the
child; (ii) a comprehensive accounting of parental and caregiver time inputs to children as well as other
aspects of the way children and adolescents spend their time; (iii) teacher-reported time use in elementary
and preschool programs; and (iv) other-than-time use measures of other resources--for example, the
learning environment in the home, teacher and administrator reports of school resources, and parentreported measures of neighborhood resources.

## Theoretical Model


Selection of interview content was guided by theories of child development in which financial, time, and
social-psychological resources are crucial to child development (Hofferth, 1995). Following Haveman and
Wolfe (1994), we view "resources" very broadly, defining them as consisting of the purchased resources,
time, interpersonal connections, and institutions that parents, schools, and communities may use to
promote the development of children. Resources actually spent on promoting child and adolescent
development are considered "investments" since, independent of whether they add to a child's well-being
immediately, time and money are expended that may enhance the future health, cognitive ability, and
productive social behavior of children.


Resources from which investments in children are made are derived from the various contexts in which
the child develops (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). We classify these as family, school, neighborhood/community,
and larger societal systems. "Societal systems" include government policies that provide resources for
children in general or for particular subgroups of children.


**Types of Family Resources**
In this project we concentrate on three general kinds of resources: _financial, time, and social-_
_psychological_, with measurement of most of these kinds of resources taken at the level of the family,
neighborhood and school. In economic models, the financial and time resources that are made available to
the children in a family (Hill & Stafford, 1985; Lazear & Michael, 1988) indicate the level of investment,
while the human capital (e.g., schooling level) of the parent indicates the likely "quality" of that
investment.


Recent work has found strong relationships between childhood income and child development. Duncan,
Brooks-Gunn and Klebanov (Duncan, et al., 1994) related patterns of childhood poverty to age-5 IQ and
behavior problems, using data from a longitudinal study of low-birthweight children observed from birth.
The duration of economic deprivation is a highly significant predictor of both outcomes; differences in the
economic resources of single- and two-parent families partly explain the effects of single-parent family
structure on IQ. Miller & Korenman (Miller & Korenman, 1994) use data from the NLSY Mother-Child
file to show that a multi-year measure of average family income is the most powerful SES-based predictor
of age-normed stunting (low height-for-weight) and wasting (low weight-for-height). Recent research
focusing on wealth shows that temporary economic difficulties can be weathered more easily by families


with greater assets (Yeung & Hofferth, 1998); consequently, their children may not be adversely affected.


Much more is known about income than about time use, but we do know that bearing children leads to a
restructuring of parental time. On the one hand children destabilize marriage by reducing the shared leisure
time of their parents, but on the other hand they may stabilize marriage by providing a source of shared
satisfaction (Hill, 1988). Time-use diaries have been extremely useful in describing the activities in which
parents spent time in the 1970s and 1980s and how much time was spent in child-oriented activities
(Timmer, Eccles & O'Brien, 1985). Despite this work, very little is known about how income and time are
distributed across children within individual families; that is, how much is allocated to various household
members. Gathering information from both partners or joint caregivers is important to understanding
intrafamilial resource allocation (Lundberg & Pollak, 1994).


_Social and psychological resources_ at the family level include characteristics of the parents such as their
mental and physical health; the quality of the relationship between them; parental values such as education
and work; and beliefs about the parental role in child rearing; and parenting style. Some of the most
important parenting style indicators include provision of learning and stimulating experiences;
communication and decision-making styles; warmth; disciplinary practices; monitoring and supervision;
and engagement. All have been shown to be empirically associated with child well-being (Maccoby &
Martin, 1983; Bornstein, 1995; Holmbeck, Paikoff & Brooks-Gunn, 1995).


Family members' choices have implications for the allocation of their limited resources. Residing in a
single-parent household means less parental time available to children (Hill & Stafford, 1980; Nock &
Kingston, 1988). Residence in a stepparent household also results in less time spent in parental interaction
than in two-biological-parent families (McLanahan, Astone & Marks, 1991; Thomson, McLanahan &
Curtin, 1992; Hetherington, 1993). Other adults in the household may provide the child with more
parental-figure time. For example, in multigenerational households, the grandmother or grandmother
figure often functions as a co-parent with regard to responsibilities and time spent with the child. Coresidence in multigenerational households presumably would offer children more resources (Furstenberg,
Morgan, Moore & Peterson, 1987; Furstenberg & Crawford, 1978; Kellum, Adams & Brown, 1982)
except in cases where the grandparents cannot help with childcare, and, if ill, might require care
themselves. The changing pattern of extended family support in black families has been studied (Hofferth,
1984; Jackson & Woodford, 1990). Many of the measures used represent the sharing of economic
resources, but time sharing across the extended family has been studied less routinely. From child diaries
which include who was present, as we propose to do, researchers could quantify the time inputs from
extended family, neighborhood groups, child care arrangements, and preschool/schools.


The quality of resources is also important. Mothers who find juggling work and parenthood stressful,
unsatisfying, or too much of a time drain may put less effort into providing stimulating experiences for
their children, or may exhibit less warmth toward their children (Wilson, Ellwood & Brooks-Gunn, 1995;
Weinraub & Wolf, 1983; Lerner & Galambos, in press). Non-working fathers may not be able to use their
extra time with their children in a productive manner because of the stress of being unemployed. Conflicts
may arise among intergenerational household members over the roles of both generations in the care of the
children, which may be translated into less warmth or less provision of learning experiences by either the
mother or grandmother (Brooks-Gunn & Chase-Lansdale, 1995).


**Types of Extra-Familial Resources**
Social capital has recently been conceptualized as an important potential resource (Coleman, 1988). Social
capital consists of the interpersonal connections that families establish with people outside their immediate
families (kin, peers, childcare providers, neighbors, schools, community). Time (e.g., helping others,
volunteer work) and money invested by the family in these connections built a stock of resources that the
family can call upon when needed. A _neighborhood_ rich in connectedness among families and individuals
and with high expectancies for its children has a level of trust and stability that could prove extremely
beneficial to children. Important time and money inputs also come from neighborhood institutions (e.g.,
schools, libraries, small businesses, youth centers) outside the family.


Though family factors typically account for more variance than school factors, school factors may make a
difference (Rutter, 1987; Jencks & Mayer, 1988). There are three aspects of _school_ resources that appear
to make a difference to children's learning: time, materials, and classroom composition. In addition,
aspects of school structure also appear to make a difference to child outcomes, including "time on task" or
actual academic learning time in the classroom (Lee & Smith, 1995; Borg, 1980). The provision of before
and after school programs and extracurricular activities, higher per pupil expenditure and low
student/teacher ratios are important resource-related attributes, in that they cost money. A mix of
race/ethnic backgrounds and ability levels constitute important resources. An appropriate mix that is
helpful to the low achievers may not be harmful to high achievers (Valerie Lee, personal communication).


Coleman's social capital paradigm applies to schools as well as to neighborhoods. It includes parental
involvement with the school and in the child's schooling. Another source of social capital is connectedness
through knowing the parents of one's child or children. This may occur through residential proximity,
close-knit neighborhoods, through school involvement and school activities or through church and other
social-organization-related activities.


**Figure 1-1. Theoretical Model for the Child Development Supplement**


Figure 1-1 presents our model of how children's outcomes are related to parental resources and parenting
practices. In the first stage, five parental behaviors--employment, marriage, childbearing, welfare receipt,
and residential mobility--are a function of background variables such as education and key determinants
of economic status. In the second stage, resources such as time, expenditures and parenting style are
modeled as a function of demographic and economic status from earlier stages. Marital stress is included


as a potential intervening factor in modeling parenting style. In the last stage, children's outcomes
(physical health, socioemotional development, and academic achievement) are a function of resources and
parenting behavior.

## The Instruments


**Child and Primary Caregiver.** The child is assessed first, using a set of standardized tests and questions.
Then, the primary caregiver (usually the mother) answers a set of interviewer-administered questions
about each child, for up to two children. In order to obtain more information about the family and to assess
parental functioning and parent-child and parent-parent relations, each primary caregiver fills out a selfadministered questionnaire (SAQ).


**Secondary Caregiver.** The collection of information from a second caregiver is a unique aspect of this
study. Each secondary caregiver fills out one SAQ about the child and a second SAQ about the household.
While assessment of father involvement in the lives of their children is a key goal, we define the second
caregiver quite broadly, since in many low-income households the second caregiver is a grandmother. Our
study is designed so that parenting, conflict, attitudes, and division of household tasks will be obtained
regardless of whether the second caregiver is a father, an unmarried male or female partner, or the child's
grandmother. Additionally, information on father involvement was obtained from the primary caregiver,
whether or not the father lives with the child.


**Absent Fathers.** Another key and unique aspect of this study is the collection of data from absent fathers.
Mothers of children who had fathers living elsewhere were asked to provide contact information on the
father and the interviewers attempted to contact and interview these men. The content of the absent fatherchild interview was similar to that of the other caregiver, focusing on the sample child. A household
booklet was also administered.


**Demographic and Economic Context.** The core PSID survey collects information on the number of
parents, number and ages of children, presence of other adults, income, employment, earnings, hours of
work, and education of all family members. Measures of parental financial resources are excellent; all
major components of wealth as well as income are collected. In 1997 a child support supplement was
funded for the first time and included in the core to provide information on father financial contributions
to children. Variables from the core can be merged with the Child Development Supplement to provide
additional information on children's families.


**Time Diary.** Another unique aspect of the study is the collection of a time diary of children's activities.
The last national data on children's time use was collected in 1981 by the University of Michigan on a
small sample of several hundred middle class families. Many studies continue to utilize these numbers
even though they are old (Task Force on Youth Development and Community Programs, 1992). Parental
time with children is the one area on which data reported in stylized form are considered unreliable
because of a strong social desirability bias. A recent study using U.S. data from the 1920s to the 1980s
reports that parental time caring for children rose rather than declined over the period, in spite of increased
maternal employment (Bryant & Zick, 1996). Until 1997 no data were available to document changes
since 1981.


**Preschools and Schools.** Resources from schools and preschool programs are important to children's
lives. The PSID-CDS collected information from the teacher and administrator of the child's school or
childcare center/program, family day care home, or other day care provider. The teacher/caregiver
provided information on the child, on activities in the classroom, and on his or her own characteristics. The
administrator provided information on the characteristics and composition of the school and its student
body. The teacher instrument for elementary school also obtained a diary of child and teacher activities
during the school day, teaching style, the resources available in the classroom, and the characteristics of


students and teacher. Teachers provided information on child behavior using many of the measures on
which the mother reports.


**Communities.** The PSID Child Development Supplement includes a rich set of measures on the
communities in which children grow up. Some of these data will be merged onto the data file from Census
Data or administrative sources (particularly income and race-ethnic characteristics of the neighborhood)
and others were asked directly of parents (such as the extent to which parents know their neighbors,
participate in community activities, and view their neighborhood as "safe"). The information collected
includes economic, social, and policy characteristics of the community in which the child lives.

# Chapter 2 _Data Collection_

## The Sample

The sample for this project was drawn from the 1997 PSID interviews. As interviews were completed for
the 1997 PSID, households with children who were Family Unit (FU) members under the age of 13 were
identified for inclusion in the Child Development Supplement. Both the PSID core sample and the new
PSID immigrant refresher sample generated Child Development cases.


The actual number of households eligible for the Child Development Supplement from the PSID was
2,705 (2,458 from the Core sample and 247 from the New Immigrant sample). A total of 2,394 households
with a total of 3,586 children were interviewed for the Child Development Supplement for a response rate
of 88.2%.

## Race and Gender Composition


Because of an initial oversampling of low-income families and the addition of a recent sample of
immigrant families, the unweighted PSID sample has a substantial number of black and other minority
families. The CDS identified 2,390 eligible families: 1,140 white families, 997 black families, 158
nonwhite, nonblack Hispanic families, 46 Asian families, 12 Native American families, and 29 families of
other nationalities (Table 1). There are a total of 3,586 children whose primary caregiver was interviewed.
Of these, boys and girls are represented in approximately equal numbers (see Table 1).


**Table 1. Race and Gender Composition of the Child Development Supplement** [a]


a The numbers in this table are unweighted.


## Stratification of Sample:

The sample was originally divided into strata according to the distance from our interviewing staff. The
sample and budget used the following strata definitions:


Stratum 1: Living in 1980 SRC primary area
Stratum 2: Living in 1960/1970 SRC primary area (major concentration of 10 to 15+ households)
Stratum 3 "clustered households": At least one day travel from the nearest SRC interviewer; 3+
households in the area
Stratum 4 "remote households": At least one day travel from the nearest SRC interviewer; <3 households
in the area


Households outside the continental U.S. were excluded from interviewing and were coded as non-sample.
All other households were included in the sample. The response rates were expected to be slightly lower
in Strata 3 and 4. Since these were interviewed predominantly by telephone, it was easier for reluctant
households to refuse to participate.

## Instrument Development


The questionnaires were developed over the course of the 11-month preproduction period, during which
time two pretests were conducted. In the first pretest, household and school questionnaires were tested
separately, because the pretest occurred in the summer. Survey Research Center interviewers conducted
the Household Pretest 1 interviews in June 1996. Columbia Teachers College recruited teachers and
administered the Teacher Pretest 1 interviews in July 1996. The second pretest, conducted in October, was
a full dress rehearsal of the entire PSID-Child Development Supplement, and included pretesting the PSID
interview and the CDS household and teacher interviews, as well as mailing the teacher and administrator
questionnaires.


For production interviewing, the following questionnaires and booklets were produced:


A large number of other forms, checklists, and related materials were also needed for this study. These


were developed throughout the preproduction period by the study director, survey manager, project
manager, and other team members.


Table 2 summarizes the questionnaires for the Child Development Supplement and the possible modes of
interview for each instrument during the production phase.


**Table 2. Questionnaires**












## Field Procedures

Data collection began in January 1997 and was completed in the field in November 1997. Production
halted during July and August, since the majority of schools were closed for the summer, and resumed in
September. In 1997, the interviewer first completed the Core PSID Family Unit (FU) interview which
determined the number and ages of children. The Core interview also contained a child support
supplement that determined whether any child in the household had an absent parent, and whether any


children from a former relationship were living elsewhere. If there was a child in the FU between birth
and age 12, the interviewer advised the respondent that they would be contacted about the Child
Development survey. The central office randomly selected two children, assigned time diary days,
determined a likely primary caregiver and whether there was an absent father, and transferred the case to
the nearest field interviewer. The field interviewer contacted the FU, explained the study, identified the
primary and secondary caregivers, made an appointment for the interview, and mailed the advance time
diary and introductory letter. The interviewer then visited the household, obtained written permission to
interview the children, obtained child assessments, child interviews, a primary caregiver interview and
assessment, time use diaries and left self-administered instruments for the primary caregiver and other
caregiver. If either of the children was in school, day care, or in the care of a babysitter, signed parent
permission slips were obtained for the teacher/caregiver, and the interviewer checked the information with
the school before mailing the teacher questionnaire, teacher time diary and administrator questionnaires to
teacher and administrator. If there was a father living outside of the home of the target child for any
sample children, the interviewer requested the name and phone number of the absent father from the
primary caregiver and proceeded to contact the absent father to conduct child and household interviewers
if consent was given. The final completed questionnaires were mailed to the central office and logged in as
received. Completed questionnaires were coded and entered in the SRC Survey Services Lab. Project staff
processed payment checks for primary caregiver, teacher, and absent father. The primary caregiver was
given a small amount of money as a token of appreciation for doing the interview, and each child received
a small gift. The teacher and absent father each received a small incentive to complete the interview.


The following is the preferred order of administration for the entire household interview (Figure 2-1). This
order could not always be followed exactly because every household composition and needs are different.
When possible, however, the field interviewers tried to adhere to the following order.


**In each household, the following steps were taken:**


1. Take PSID interview.
2. If there is an eligible child, a Child Case is generated by Data Control.
3. Data Control staff print a set of labels, CAI (Computer Assisted Interviewing) Sample Management
System (CSMS) checklist, and an information sheet for the household and teacher.
4. The Data Services research assistant prepares and mails the sample line packet (containing coversheets,
labels and information sheets) to the interviewer assigned to the case.
5. The interviewer reviews the sample line packet and labels the appropriate questionnaires.
6. The interviewer contacts the household, verifies the primary caregiver selection, explains the study,
verifies the mailing address, and sets up an appointment for an in-person interview.
7. The interviewer mails an introductory packet to the household containing a study brochure, introduction
letter, and time diaries.
8. The interviewer visits the household and gets written permission to interview the child(ren) from the
primary caregiver. The interviewer administers the child assessments and primary caregiver-child
questionnaire. The time diaries are reviewed and edited with the primary caregiver (and the child, if
appropriate).
9. The interviewer gives the appropriate self-administered questionnaires to the primary caregiver and the
other caregiver (if one is in the household).
10. The interviewer obtains written parental permission to contact teachers and caregivers for children in
school, preschool, or child care.
11. The interviewer obtains contact information for fathers living outside the home, if applicable.
12. After the interview is completed, the interviewer edits the interviews and enters complete information
about the contact and the interview into CSMS.
13. The interviewer mails the school questionnaires to the appropriate teachers, caregivers, and school
administrators.

14. The interviewer notifies Ann Arbor via CSMS that the teacher information has been mailed.
15. The interviewer mails an introductory letter to the father living outside the home, if applicable.
16. The interviewer contacts and interviews the father living outside the home, if applicable.


17. The interviewer edits the father outside the home questionnaires, if applicable.
18. The interviewer reports the completed household session to the Team Leader (TL).
19. The TL instructs the interviewer to mail the completed questionnaires to Ann Arbor (if no verification is
required) or to the TL (for verification and evaluation).
20. The interviewer mails completed and edited interviews to Ann Arbor or the TL, as instructed.
21. The TL evaluates and verifies the interview, if applicable, gives feedback to the interviewer, and mails
completed interviews to Ann Arbor.
22. The Ann Arbor staff logs completed questionnaires as they are received from interviewers, primary
caregivers, other caregivers, teachers, childcare providers, and administrators.
23. The Survey Services Lab (SSL) staff mails reminder postcards one week after the interviewer has mailed
the materials to the teachers and administrators.
24. The SSL staff conducts reminder calling for nonresponding teachers, caregivers, and administrators
beginning two weeks after the interviewer has mailed the materials to the teachers and administrators. A
second questionnaire is mailed by the SSL staff if necessary.
25. A total of two rounds of 5 calls each will be made before coding the case as final non-response, if the
questionnaires are not returned.
26. The SSL staff codes and enters the completed time use diaries into the SAS data entry program created by
PSID staff.
27. The SSL staff enters all completed questionnaires into the SAS data entry program created by PSID staff.
28. The SSL conducts check coding on 10% of Home Time Diaries and Home-based Care Time Diaries, and
performs double entry verification on questionnaires for quality control purposes.
29. Completed questionnaires are stored by PSID staff once the questionnaires are coded and processed.

# Chapter 3 _Respondent Definitions_

The respondents in the Child Development Supplement have already been included in at least one PSID
interview. In fact, the majority of respondents were from long-time PSID respondent families. Many are
the children of original core PSID respondents. By matching 1986 ID and person number, information on
these respondents and their families can be obtained from previous waves of the core PSID as well as
from the 1997 wave. Eligibility for the Child Development Supplement is based on the ages of the PSID
family's children. If the family has a child age 12 or younger, the entire PSID Household Unit is eligible
for the Child Development Supplement.


Adult respondents include selected persons who have influence over the child's development. The
following is a list of potential respondents in a household case. A household case would never include
every respondent on this list. A face-to-face interview will be conducted only with the children and
primary caregiver.

## Child


Up to two children age 12 and younger per PSID Family Unit were eligible for inclusion in this study. All
eligible children had to be members of the PSID Sample; that is, they were the child of a sample member.
Therefore, it is possible that some children in a household were not eligible for inclusion in this study. If
the child was under 3 years of age, although still eligible for the study, the child was not personally
interviewed, but information was gathered on this child from his or her parents and caregivers. The age of
the children at the time of the PSID interview was used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the CDS
study. The child's actual age at the time of the survey, however, was used to determine the specific
portions of instruments to administer to the child. The actual age at the survey date was also used to
calculate standardized test scores.

## Primary Caregiver

The main respondent for this study was the primary caregiver, usually the child's mother. If the mother
was not living with the child, the primary caregiver could be the father, legal guardian or person who
knows most about the child's activities. If the primary caregiver was interviewed about two children, the
interviewer filled out a separate questionnaire for each child. The primary caregiver also completed two
time diaries for each child and one self-administered household booklet.


The following is the checkpoint that the field interviewer followed to determine the primary caregiver in
most cases. The list is priority ordered; that is, the mother is the first choice.


_DETERMINE PROBABLE PRIMARY CAREGIVER AND MARK ON HH INFORMATION SHEET (IF_
_POSSIBLE), USING CRITERIA BELOW:_


1. MOTHER (Biological, Step, Foster, or Adoptive), or a "WIFE" of PSID Head
2. FATHER (Biological, Step, Foster, or Adoptive)


3. LEGAL GUARDIAN OF CHILD
4. ADULT in HU who takes primary responsibility for child (not someone paid, e.g., a babysitter or a nanny)

## Other Caregiver

The Other Caregiver is defined as another adult in the Household Unit who helps raise the child. This is
usually the child's father or the mother's spouse/partner, but could also be the grandmother of the child or
another adult relative or non-adult living in the household. This respondent also completed several selfadministered questionnaires (one for each child and one household booklet).


The following is the checkpoint that the field interviewer followed to determine the Other Caregiver in
most cases. These are also priority ordered.


_DETERMINE PROBABLE OTHER CAREGIVER AND MARK ON HH INFORMATION SHEET (IF_
_POSSIBLE), USING CRITERIA BELOW:_


1. FATHER (Biological, Step, Foster, or Adoptive)
2. GRANDMOTHER of Child
3. BOYFRIEND or GIRLFRIEND of Primary Caregiver
4. OTHER (Adult) RELATIVE of Child
5. OTHER (Adult) NONRELATIVE (not someone paid, e.g., a babysitter or a nanny)

## Father Outside of the Home


The father outside of the home is the biological or adoptive father since infancy who is not living in the
home of the target child. A phone interview was conducted with him; the interviewer administered one
child questionnaire for each child and one household questionnaire.

## Preschool/Day Care Teacher

The preschool/day care teacher is the child's main preschool teacher or daycare provider. The day care
center must be located in a business location to be termed "day care." A time diary for the child is
included in this questionnaire.

## Preschool/Daycare Administrator

A self-administered questionnaire was sent to the administrator of the school or child care center that the
child attends. The administrator questionnaire asked about the school or program environment, not
specifically about the child.

## Elementary/Middle School Teacher

The child's main elementary or middle school teacher received a mailed self-administered questionnaire.
A time diary for the child was included in this questionnaire. If the child changes classes regularly
throughout the day, the teacher skips the time diary portion of the questionnaire. Instead, this diary was
included in the Child questionnaire administered to the target child. For children in home schooling, the
parent or household member who teaches the child was given this teacher questionnaire to fill out.

## Elementary/Middle School Administrator

A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to the administrator of the school that the child attends. The
administrator questionnaire asked about the school or program environment but not specifically about the
child.

## Home-Based Care Provider


The home-based care provider cares for children in a residential home. That home may be the provider's
home or the child's home; regular baby-sitters are included. A self-administered questionnaire, including a


time diary for the child, was sent to the child's care provider. A time diary for the child is included in this
questionnaire.

## Field Interviewer


The interviewer was also a respondent/observer in this study. The interviewer observes the primary
caregiver's interactions with the child. These observations are recorded in thumbnail sketches; additional
questions are asked at the back of the interviewer-administered primary caregiver child questionnaire.

# Chapter 4 _Response Rates_

## Household Interview

The survey period began in March 1997 and, with a two-month break in July and August, ended on
December 6, 1997. The study completed interviews with 2,380 child households and 3,563 children. Six
hundred and nine African American children were added to this sample with funds from the Annie E.
Casey Foundation and the William T. Grant Foundation. The response rate was 90% for those families
regularly interviewed in the core PSID and 84% for those contacted the first time this year for the
immigrant refresher to the sample. The combined response rate for both groups was 88%. Table 3 shows
the response rates. The reason the response rate to the child questionnaire (child assessments) is only
79.5% is that about one-tenth of the families were out of range of our interviewers and were not close
enough to at least two other eligible families to justify the high cost of traveling to obtain that case. An
interview was conducted by telephone to obtain the other parts of the interview so that the information
from parents and teachers would be available. We identified more absent fathers than expected (36% of
children had an absent father), but were able to obtain interviews with fewer. For schools from whose
administrators we did not receive a response, we plan to obtain supplemental information from public data
bases such as the Quality of Education Data (QED).

**Response Rates Based on Number of Children**














**Response Rates Based on Number of Households**

## Fathers Living Outside the Target Child's Home


In 1997, the total number of CDS households with children under age 13 was 2,380; the total number of
children was 3,563. We identified 1,431 children with absent fathers in 1,005 households in the PSID.


Of these 1,431 children:


**20%** **283 have completed absent father interviews.**


**31%** **439 the primary caregiver refused to provide information on**
**the father.**






**Figure 4-1. Absent Father Contact Results**


Deleting from the total sample those we did not seek to interview (in jail, deceased, non-sample, and
foreign), we have 1,294 cases. The response rate from these 1,294 cases is 22% for children's absent
fathers. Mothers refused in 34% of the cases, 32% were not located, and 12% were refusals by the father's
household. See Figure 4-1.


Of those fathers whom we were able to contact (452), the response rate was 64%:


Once we reached the father, cooperation was 64%. The main stumbling blocks were obtaining information
from the mothers and tracking the fathers.


We are coding the reasons the primary caregiver reports for refusing to provide information on the father.
These include such reasons as "he never sees the child; doesn't know where he is; doesn't know the father;
does not want the father to know about the child; a child of rape," etc. We end our contact efforts at this
point. Obtaining the mother's cooperation is key to locating absent fathers.


The 416 (29%) children's fathers for whom we obtained some information from the primary caregiver but
were not able to contact the father is a number that could be altered. We did not have the funding to track


these fathers, but assume that such efforts could be successful.


Finally, fathers of 68 children are in jail/prison. We had not budgeted to interview these men. They are a
"captive" audience; it should be possible to interview them with additional time and funding. Permission
from the prison administration is usually required.


Given that the focus of the CDS interview with the absent father is his involvement with the child, absent
fathers who have not been in contact with their child over the past year will provide little additional
information over that provided by the mother on frequency and extent of contact. The loss of these hardto-reach groups of men does not compromise our particular study. However, these parameters should be
helpful to researchers with different purposes.

_Key Objectives of the Questionnaire:_
To obtain information on...


Children's reading and math ability.
Children's memory.
Children's self-esteem as it relates to school subjects and to their general lives.
Children's day at school, middle-school children.


For the most part this study uses existing measures to assess children and their families. These measures are
summarized in Chapter 6. Children's well-being is defined in terms of cognitive/academic, socioemotional, and
physical development (Brooks-Gunn, 1990; McCormick & Brooks-Gunn, 1989). Three basic types of outcomes linked
to children's well-being and future success were measured. These are:


1. School progress, academic achievement and cognitive ability, including grade failure/progression, highest grade
completed, verbal and math ability and literacy.
2. Socioemotional well-being, through the behavior problems and positive behavior scales, and
3. Health.

**Time Diaries**
Assessment of parent-child interaction often rests largely on reports of children's time use. There are several ways of
assessing how much time and in what activities parents and children engage. The most accurate way to collect such
data would be through observation. However, such methods are costly, intrusive, and limited in the amount of a day
that can be covered. Another accurate way to collect information is by time sampling, in which respondents write
down the activity they are engaged in whenever a beeper sounds. This methodology is also costly, intrusive and
limited. The most common method in survey research is to ask parents directly how much time they spend in certain
activities, such as reading to their child. While simple and widely used, this method is known to be biased. First, it is
subject to social desirability bias. Parents will report more time spent on desirable activities (such as reading) than on
less desirable ones. Second, there is no baseline against which to check consistency, validity, or reliability. Thus times
have been shown to be quite inaccurately reported (Juster & Stafford, 1985). In contrast, substantial methodological
work has established the validity and reliability of data collected in time-diary form (Juster & Stafford, 1985). The
instrument for assessing time use is a "time diary," which is a chronological report by the child and/or the child's
primary caretaker about the child's activities over a specified recent 24-hour period, beginning at midnight (who the
reporter is depends on the age of the child). The time diary is interviewer-administered and asks several questions
about the child's flow of activities, such as what they were doing at that time, when the activity began and ended, and
what else they were doing (if they were engaged in multiple activities). The Child Development Supplement to the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics also added two questions: "Who was (child) doing that with?" and "Who else was
there?" These added questions, when linked to activity codes such as playing or being read to, provide unbiased details
on the extent of parent/child one-on-one interactions and availability of the parents. The advantage of such questions is
that total time in one day has to add to 24 hours. Consequently, while individual times may be slightly inaccurate, the
times are consistent with one another. The disadvantage of the time diary is that it represents only a sample of
children's days. Thus while it accurately represents the activities of a sample of children on a given day, it is only a
very small sample of a given child's days and, as such, has limited reliability. To improve reliability, most time-use
studies obtain at least one weekend and one weekday and many also obtain multiple samples over a period of time,
such as a year.


Since the data collection format is open-ended--an advantage for avoiding biases toward "good" activities and away
from "bad" activities but a potential pitfall for proper interpretation of the data--precise, clear, and well-focused
definitions of activities are vital. Fortunately, the 1975-1981 Time Use Study has paved the way in guidelines for
coding children's time-diary reports (Juster & Stafford, 1985). Working with several child development experts and
other time-use experts from many disciplines and representing a wide range of countries and cultures, Hill, Stafford,
Juster, and colleagues in the 1981 follow-up of the 1975-1981 Time Use Study spent considerable time and effort
designing a time-use methodology appropriate to children. The methodology is not onerous. Researchers have found
that parents of young children enjoy working with their youngsters to provide the children's time diaries, which take
about 15 minutes per child per day, and can adequately represent the child's day (Timmer et al., 1985).

# Chapter 6 _Assessments and Scales_

## **Assessments**

**Woodcock-Johnson Revised Tests of Achievement**
Children age 3 and older were assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson Revised Tests of Achievement (WJR), Form B (Woodcock & Johnson, 1989). The younger children (3-5 year olds) were administered two
subscales of the WJ-R, the Letter-Word and Applied Problems tests. Older children (6-12 year olds) were
administered two additional subtests, the Passage Comprehension and Calculation tests. These scales can
be used individually, or in the case of the four subscales, combined to create scores for Broad Reading
and Broad Math. When applicable, the Spanish version of the WJ-R (Batería-R, Form A), was used for
children whose primary language was Spanish. Table 4 gives a brief description of each subscale, age
group that were administered the tests, and reliability of the scale.


**Table 4. Description of Woodcock-Johnson-R Subtests**

Note: [1] Woodcock, R.W. & Johnson, M. B. (1989).


The WJ-R test contains nine subtests measuring different aspects of academic achievement. The four
chosen for this study cover only the reading and math portion of the test. These tests were chosen due to
the ease of administration as well as their brevity. On average, across all age groups, test administration
took approximately 40 minutes (Table 5). As shown in the table, the youngest children took the shortest
amount of time and the oldest the longest.


**Table 5. Length of Time, in Minutes for the Child Questionnaire, by Age of Child and Assessment.**


**Digit Span**
The Memory for Digit Span test from the WISC-III, used in the NLSY-Child Study, is also used to assess
children's short-term memory (Wechsler, 1974). In the first part of the test, the child is asked to listen and
repeat a sequence of numbers said by the interviewer. In the second part, the child is asked to repeat them
in reverse order. The sequence increases in length until the child can no longer repeat the sequence
correctly. The PSID Child Development Supplement asked this of children 3 and older.


**Self-Esteem**
We measure task perception in reading and math and self-esteem of children age 8 and older using a set of
scales developed and validated by Jacquelynne Eccles (Eccles, Wigfield, Harold & Blumenfeld, 1993),
with an additional subscale on global self-concept created by H.W. Marsh and used in the National
Longitudinal Survey of Canadian Children and Youth (SDQ-I) (National Longitudinal Survey of Children
and Youth, 1997), and the Marsh Self-Description Questionnaire (Marsh, 1990).

## Scales


**Primary Caregiver-Child Questionnaire**
_Physical Health of the Child._ Questions about the physical health of each child (A2-A34) were drawn
from the redesigned National Health Interview Survey and from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth. Additional advice was obtained from Lorraine Klerman, University of Birmingham School of
Public Health, and Marie McCormick, Harvard School of Public Health. The questions first cover height
and weight. They inquire about conditions surrounding birth, such as birth weight, special health care and
problems at birth, breast-feeding, general health at birth, health care coverage, receipt of government
subsidies during pregnancy. The instrument then asks about experiences following birth, such as
hospitalizations, whether the child was ever diagnosed to have any of a set of chronic conditions ranging
from asthma to developmental disabilities, visits to a health care professional for illness, injury, or
emotional problem, frequency of routine health check-ups, and health care coverage.


The major scales of interest to analysts are general health (A34) and disability (A26). The general health
question (A34) is the following: "In general, would you say (child's) health is excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor?" The question has a long history in surveys and is the one question that almost all surveys


include. The disability series (A26) asks "Does (child) currently have any physical or mental condition
that would limit or prevent (his/her) ability to... do usual childhood activities such as play, or participate in
games or sports, attend school (preschool or day care) regularly, or do regular school work?" This series
was taken from the NLSY-Mother/Child Supplement. Question A21 asks about a series of chronic
conditions: "Has your doctor or health professional ever said that (child) had. . ." Frequency distributions
of children's health and conditions are included in our first report: _Healthy Environments, Healthy_
_Children: Children in Families_ which can be downloaded from our web site.


_HOME Scale._ The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form from the Caldwell
and Bradley HOME Inventory (Caldwell & Bradley, 1984) is used as a measure of the cognitive
stimulation and emotional support parents provide to children. The particular items used in the PSID Child
Development Supplement were taken directly from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, MotherChild Supplement so that the scales would be as similar as possible (Baker, Keck, Mott & Quinlan, 1993)
(Table 6). This scale comprises a large number of items in sections B-F and L of the primary
caregiver/child questionnaire, and a few items in the primary caregiver/household questionnaire (Q2A26Q2A28). With a few minor exceptions, this objective was accomplished. The raw scores from the total
scale, HOME1, are included on the primary caregiver-child file. A second scale, HOME2, which excludes
the three items involving fathers--how often spends time with the father, how often spends time with the
father outdoors, and how often eats a meal with the father--was also constructed and included on the file
for those analysts who do not want to include those items.


_Aggravation in Parenting._ The aggravation in parenting scale (Q1B11a-e) and (Q2A29a-d) was developed
by Child Trends, Inc., for the JOBS child outcomes study to measure parenting stress that parents may feel
as a result of changes in employment, income, and other factors in their lives. The five items in the
primary caregiver/child questionnaire focus on the child while the four items in the primary
caregiver/household questionnaire focus on parenting in general. The five items used in the JOBS study
are Q1B11b, Q1B11c, B11d, and Q2A29a and Q2A29b. The five-item scale used in the JOBS study has
an alpha of .69. The JOBS evaluation found maternal aggravation in parenting to be linked to maternal
employment and to higher levels of child behavior problems.


_School Enrollment and Expectations._ In order to know about the child's school enrollment and attendance,
the primary caregiver was asked to report on the child's enrollment in school, when first began
kindergarten, grade attending, type of school (private/public), school tuition, attendance, receipt of meals
under the school lunch and breakfast programs, whether attended special class or school for gifted
students, whether was classified as needing special education, whether ever participated in Head Start,
whether ever repeated a grade. These questions (G1-G20) come from the National Household Education
Survey, from the NLSY, and from the 1995 PSID. G21 asks parental expectations for the child's
completed schooling and also comes from the NLSY and NELS:88.


_Behavior Problems Index._ The behavior problem scale (G23, G32) was developed by James Peterson and
Nicholas Zill to measure the incidence and severity of child behavior problems in a survey setting
(Peterson & Zill, 1986). Many of the items are from the Achenbach Behavior Problems Checklist
(Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1981). Exactly the same set of items used in the NLSY was used in the PSID
Child Development Supplement in order to maximize comparability between the two data sets, though the
PSID-CDS asked the questions were drawn from of children 3 and older while the NLSY began the
questions at age 4. The scale is based on responses by the primary caregiver as to whether a set of 30
problem behaviors is often, sometimes, or never true of the child. Behaviors include having sudden
changes in mood or feeling, is fearful or anxious, bullies or is cruel or mean, demands a lot of attention.
Behaviors are also divided into two subscales, a measure of externalizing or aggressive behavior and a
measure of internalizing, withdrawn or sad behavior. Scores provided are raw scores on the scales. Items
G23aa, bb, cc and dd were added by NLSY staff to provide additional measurement for the withdrawn
behavior scale. Finally, items G32 a and b are part of the Behavior Problems Scale but are only applicable
to school-age children. We created one behavior problems scale by summing the scores on the raw items
with direction of scoring reversed, using the 30 items for all children. We also created separate scores for


two subscales, internal or withdrawn and external or aggressive. The analyst can either add the two items
for school-age children to the 30-item scale, or, as we did in _Healthy Environments, Healthy Children:_
_Children in Families_ use the two items as a separate scale of school problems. Table 6 shows how the 30
items for all children 3 and older map onto the external and internal scales.


**Table 6. Behavior Problems Index Factors and Reliabilities**


*Not included in the scale


_Positive Behavior Scale._ The Positive Behavior Scale (G24) was developed by Denise Polit for use in the
New Chance Evaluation (Polit, 1998). The purpose of the scale was to tap the positive aspects of children's
lives, including self-esteem, social competence, self-control, obedience/compliance, and persistence. The
original scale consisted of 25 items evaluated on a 10-point scale, from not at all like my child to very
much like my child. The scale used in the PSID-CDS consists of 10 items that were selected by Child
Trends, Inc., for use in the JOBS evaluation. The primary caregiver is asked whether each statement
applies to child, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means "not at all like my child," and 5 means "totally like
my child," and 2,3, and 4 are somewhere in-between. A factor analysis of the original 25-item scale
resulted in three dimensions: compliance/self-control, social competence/social sensitivity, and autonomy.


_Household Tasks._ The set of items about household interaction (G25-a,b,c,f,i,j) was designed to tap
maternal and paternal interaction with children in ways that are not dependent on purchased toys or
equipment. That is, these are normal activities that could be done in any household. The purpose was to
have a scale of parent-child interaction that would not be income-biased. The set of items
(G25d,e,g,h,k,m) are items measuring cognitive stimulation. The items about the computer/video games
and board, card games, and puzzles may be income-biased.


_Participation in Child's Education._ This scale (G28) measures parental involvement in the child's school,
which includes meeting or conversing with the child's teacher, school principal, or school counselor,
attending a school event, attending the parent-teacher's association meeting, and volunteering in the
classroom. The items for this scale were taken from various education surveys, including the NELS:88, the
Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, and the National Household Education Survey.


_Parental Difficulty in School Involvement._ This set of items (G29) was designed in conjunction with the
U.S. Department of Education, which was interested in finding out the barriers to parental involvement
with their children's schools. It is drawn partially from the National Household Education Survey 1996.


_Number of School Changes_ . This question (G30) comes from the NELS:88.


_Parent-Child Communication about School._ This scale (G31) measures the frequency and nature of
communication between parent and child about school. The questions are asked only of parents of children
enrolled in school. These questions were modeled after questions in the NELS:88 parent baseline survey,
but modified to be appropriate for younger children.


_Parental Monitoring._ This scale (G33) comes from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, MotherChild file. "Think now about how things are going in general in (child's) life. Please rate each of the
following parts of (child's) life as either excellent, good, fair or poor." The NLSY scale has six items
including health, friendships, relationship with you (primary caregiver), feelings about himself, prospects
for the future, and relationships with brothers, sisters, or other children he lives with." We added two
additional items to tap a relationship with a teacher or caregiver and the relationship with the child's other
parent.


_Parental Warmth._ This 6-item scale (G37) was developed by Child Trends, Inc., for use in the JOBS
observational study to measure the warmth of the relationship between the child and parent. These
measures can also be used with items in the interviewer observation of the home environment in Section L
that ask for interviewer report of maternal warmth observed during the visit (L4, L8, L13, L15).


_Child Care Arrangements._ The series on child care arrangements (Section H) comes from the National
Child Care Survey 1990 and other related child care questionnaires. The retrospective history was based


both on the National Child Care Survey retrospective history and on the experimental retrospective history
asked in the 1989 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (Mott & Baker, 1989).


_Conflict with Absent Parent._ The purpose of this scale (J28) is to assess the degree of conflict and/or
agreement between the parent the child lives with and the absent parent over issues such as where the
child lives, how he/she is raised, visits, discipline, etc. This scale was drawn from the National Survey of
Families and Households, supplemented by additional items from other scales.


_Absent Parent Interaction._ The purpose of the series of items in J29 is to obtain information about the
frequency and types of activities in which absent parents are involved with their children. This series was
drawn from the National Survey of Families and Households and the JOBS evaluation


_Absent Parent Expenditures on Child._ This scale (J30) supplements the core questions on child support.
Even if the absent parent provides child support, he may also provide other things for the child either in
cash or in kind. This series obtains information on other contributions absent fathers make to their
children. The series was drawn from the National Survey of Families and Household and the JOBS
evaluation.


_Food Security._ Twelve percent of all U.S. households and 17% of all U.S. households with children under
18 years of age experience some level of food insecurity (Hamilton, et al., 1997a). However, we do not
know the consequences of food insecurity for those who experience it. Available evidence about the
consequences of food insecurity in the U.S. consists of aggregate statistics on health outcomes, such as
infant mortality rates for poor groups in comparison to others. Thus, we do not have direct evidence that
indicates the effect of food insecurity on child well-being.


With funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, we added the food security measurement scale
(Section K) developed to measure food security in the United States (Hamilton, et al., 1997a). Information
on the use of and validation of the scale are contained in publications by Hamilton and colleagues
(Hamilton, et al., 1997b;Price, Hamilton & Cook, 1997).


**Primary Caregiver-Household Questionnaire**
_Neighborhood Measures._ Question A1 measures the length of time the respondent has lived in the
neighborhood. Question A2 comes from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and measures general
neighborhood satisfaction. The majority of the questions are based upon Robert Sampson's research
(Sampson, 1991). The question A3 attempts to determine what the respondent thinks his/her neighborhood
is (Elliott, Huizenga & Menard, 1989). Question A6 gets at home ownership and race/ethnic composition
of the neighborhood, and was drawn from Del Elliot's Denver Youth survey (Elliott, et al., 1996).
Questions A4-A6 attempt to determine the ratio of local friendship/acquaintanceship ties relative to the
total population. This comes from (Elliott, et al., 1996). Question A7 defines extent of neighborhood
anonymity. Social cohesion/capital in the neighborhood is measured in Question A11--How likely is it that
a neighbor would do something if...? This set of items also was drawn from (Elliott, et al., 1996). Social
capital is measured in A8, in terms of community activities the respondent and partner participated in
within the past month. Safety is measured in A12, which was drawn from the Hispanic Neighborhood
Study.


_Household Security._ Neighborhood safety is also measured in A13, regarding security measure on their
home--whether they have a security system or bars on the doors and whether they leave doors unlocked.
This set of items was created for the PSID-CDS.


_Religion._ Attendance at religious services and the importance of religion are included in A9 and A10.
These questions were drawn from the Detroit Area Study.


_Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale._ A14 is the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1986).


_Social Support._ Our measures of social support, A15-A19, were drawn from the National Survey of


Families and Households and from the 1980 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. This set of items measures
receipt of and provision of assistance to others who are not living with the respondent over the past month.
Assistance includes time help, moral and emotional support, and help in an emergency. Information on
monetary assistance is contained in the core PSID interview and, for that reason, was not asked here.


_Pearlin Self-Efficacy Scale._ QA20 is the Pearlin Self-Efficacy Scale (Pearlin, Lieberman, Menaghan &
Mullan, 1981).


_Child Rearing Values and Rules._ Developed by Duane Alwin (Alwin, 1990), these items (A22-A25)
appeared in the Detroit Area Study and the General Social Survey.


_Parental Modernity Scale._ A32 was developed by Schaeffer and Edgerton to assess the modernity or
traditionality of parents' values and attitudes about childrearing (Schaefer & Edgerton, 1985).


_Parenting Attitudes and Opinions._ This set of items (A33-A36) was developed for the PSID-CDS. It
supplements the above set questions on parental attitudes and values in child rearing. It is widely believed
that some parents push their children to succeed because they believe that hard work results in success,
while others do not push their children because they believe that natural ability is most crucial. Still others
may believe that success is due to interpersonal relationships. A34 is designed to see what types of
compromises or life style adjustments parents have made to make life better for their children and comes
from the 1995 follow-up to the National Survey of Adolescent Males (Sonenstein & Pleck, 1995). A35
and A36 attempt to get at the involvement of the respondent's own biological parent and to what extent the
respondent models their parenting after that of their own parent.


_Gender Roles._ The basic set of gender role items (A37a-p,t,u) was taken from the National Survey of
Families and Households. It was supplemented with questions on fathering drawn from the Being a Father
Scale by Joseph Pleck (A37v-cc) (Pleck, 1997). The majority of the items were drawn from Palkowitz's
Role of the Father Questionnaire (Palkowitz, 1984), which taps the belief that THE father role is important
in child development. Item 37bb is a new item developed by Pleck which taps the belief that responsibility
of male breadwinner role justifies lower involvement with children. Item 37cc, also new, taps belief in
equal paternal competence. A37q,r tap attitudes regarding maternal work and nonparental child care. A37s
taps attitudes towards spanking.


_Parent Disagreement._ A40 was drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the National
Survey of Families and Households as a measure of extent of agreement between parents on daily
activities.


_Joint Goals_ . A41 was designed for the PSID-CDS to gauge the extent to which respondent and partner
have joint marital/family goals for the future.


_Family Conflict._ A42 was drawn from the National Survey of Families and Households (Sweet, Bumpass
& Call, 1988) and attempts to examine methods of conflict resolution among family members.


_Alcohol Use._ The series A44-A49 is a standard set of questions that is used to evaluate whether the
respondent has a drinking problem and whether there is any negative influence of any other household
member's drinking habits on children.


_Economic Strain._ This set of items (A53) was drawn from the work of Glen Elder and Rand Conger in
measuring experiences of economic or financial stress and strain and practical responses to such financial
pressures (Conger & Elder, 1994).


_Regular Activity Schedules._ This schedule of parental work over the past week (A54) comes from the
National Child Care Survey 1990 (Hofferth, Brayfield, Deich & Holcomb, 1991).

# Chapter 7 _Pretests_

## Household Pretest 1 - June, 1996

Household Pretest 1 was not a normal pretest, because its major purpose was not primarily to test the
questions. The items in the questionnaires for this study have been used extensively in other studies. While
we did test the questions, the main goal of Pretest 1 was to test the procedures for this study. Specifically,
we were trying to find ways to help minimize the burden on both the interviewer and respondent and to
make things go as smoothly as possible to help achieve a high response rate. The pretest was used to find
ways to improve the order of administration, to develop tools to help keep track of things, and to develop
procedures for production data collection. The pretest consisted of 23 households with 45 children.

## Teacher Pretest 1 - July, 1996


The respondents for Teacher Pretest 1 were teachers who were attending summer school classes at
Teachers College, Columbia University. Presentations were made in four summer school classes, four
professors were given flyers, and flyers were posted around the campus. In addition, to recruit more
preschool teachers, local preschools were called. The results were as follows:


**TABLE 8. Number of Interviews, Teacher Pretest**


As a result of this pretest, we learned that the respondent burden was very high. The instruments were
scaled back in length to help alleviate this burden. We also learned that only three of the responding
teachers had any concerns regarding confidentiality. The majority of the teachers felt comfortable
completing the questionnaire.

## Pretest 2 - October - November, 1996


The number of household interviews completed in Pretest 2 was 51. For the following tables data from up
to 49 households (with 85 children) were used; the information from 2 households was not complete.


N=19 households (30 children) from households that were included from the immigrant PSID
pretest.


N= 9 households (15 children) from households that were included from the Core PSID
pretest.


N=21 households (40 children) from Achild-only households (where no PSID interview was
taken).


In preproduction, up to three children could be selected from each sample household. The following table
shows the percentage of households where one, two, and three children were included in the study.


**Table 9. Number of Household Interviews, Pretest 2**


The next table shows the distribution of the children's ages for Pretest 2.


**Table 10. Distribution of Children's Ages, Pretest 2**


The following table shows the average length of each interviewer-administered instrument in Pretest 2.


**Table 11. Length of Interviews, Pretest 2**


The next table shows the eligibility rates and response rates for each questionnaire.


**Table 12. Eligibility Rates, Pretest 2**




   - Base N = 49 Households; 85 children
** 2 refused to give information; 2 did not know where father was.
*** Elementary Admin includes duplicate administrators (1 admin for 2 kids); Don't know (DK) why the
number eligible is different from elementary teachers.


The following table summarizes the contact attempts for the Pretest 2 households.


**Table 13. Contacts, Pretest 2**


The second test of the teacher questionnaires occurred concurrently with the full pretest of the household
questionnaires. After the household portion of the interview process was completed, the field interviewer
asked for the respondent's signed permission form allowing us to contact the child's teacher and
administrator. The interviewer then mailed self-administered questionnaires to both the teacher and
administrator. In Pretest 2, the Survey Research Center followed up to increase the response rate. This
consisted of mailing a reminder postcard to the teacher and administrator one week after the field
interviewer mailed the questionnaire packets. If the teacher or administrator had not returned the
questionnaire one week after the postcard had been sent, the research technicians began to conduct
reminder calling. Up to six calls total could be placed to each teacher and administrator.


Table 14 presents the results of Pretest 2. There were 85 eligible children in this pretest. Sixty-eight
children were either in elementary/middle school or preschool/daycare. Teachers of middle school children
did not receive the time diary because the children change classes and they would not know what the
children do all day. Instead, the middle school children filled out the time diaries as part of the household
interview.


**TABLE 14. RESPONSE RATES, PRETEST 2**


Questionnaire Type # of questionnaires sent # of questionnaires received Response Rate


Reminder/thank you postcards were sent to all teachers and administrators. Forty-five schools were called.
The average number of calls per school was 2.5 calls. The minimum number of calls to a school was zero
and the maximum number of calls was six calls.


As a result of this pretest, the teacher time diaries were combined into the teacher questionnaires so that
the teachers would be more willing to complete both instruments. A question was added to the
elementary/middle school teacher questionnaire to skip middle school teachers over the time diary portion
of the questionnaire. A separate questionnaire for home-based care providers or "baby-sitters" was
developed for use in production to capture this type of care arrangement as well. A corresponding
administrator questionnaire was not needed for this type of care arrangement.


The respondent burden still proved to be high in the second pretest. In response, the instruments were
further scaled back to help alleviate respondent burden and the questionnaires were tested to determine if
they could be administered over the phone. It was thought that administering the questionnaire over the
phone would be easier for the respondent. The questionnaires were successfully completed over the phone
but were even more time-consuming. The time diary in particular was cumbersome when administered
over the phone. As a result, we decided not to change the data collection method. The procedure for the
teacher and administrator questionnaires remained the same for production.


**Results of Pretest 2**
The following procedures changed after Pretest 2 for production data collection.


Pretest 2 interviewed up to three eligible children in a household; production is limited to two children per
household.
The teacher time diaries were incorporated into the teacher questionnaire for production; they were
separate instruments for pretest.
We added a home-based care questionnaire for babysitters for production, based on our pretest experience.
The child time diaries were reformatted for production.
The self-administered questionnaires were reformatted for production.
The partner of the primary caregiver was redefined as other caregiver for production to include
grandmothers of sample children and other adults living in the target child's home.

# Chapter 8 _Coding_

The Coding role can be broken down into two general tasks: Time Diary Coding activities and Direct Data Entry
(DDE). The Survey Research Center was responsible for maintaining data quality while moving the raw data from
paper into electronic data.

## Coding


Extensive coding of the Home Time Diaries and School Time Diaries was required before data entry. A
complex coding scheme was developed to define the activities described in the Home Time Diaries.
Additional codes were developed to describe the location of the activities, all participants in the activity,
and others nearby. These codes can be found in the full coding manual that lists the codes and describes
the special concerns which might arise when coding time diaries. This is available from study staff on
request.


The codebook for the Child Development Supplement was adapted from a time diary codebook developed
in the late 1970s and early 1980s for a project entitled "Time Use in Social and Economic Accounts"
(Juster & Stafford, 1985). Some modifications for coding children's activities were added in the early
1980s. Coding schemes were revised for the 1997 data collection, and revisions were made during the
coding process in order to cover all activities.

## Direct Data Entry


In DDE, the data from all of the various questionnaires (including the Time Diaries) was entered into the
SAS data entry application, verifying that entry was accurate, and logging and filing materials as tasks are
completed.

## Occupation Coding


Occupation coding was used in the Father Outside of the Home-Household Questionnaire. All other
occupational information for the household can be found in the PSID interview. We used the 1970 threedigit Census Bureau occupational codes, the same codes that the PSID uses.

# Chapter 9 _Quality Control Procedures_

## Field Procedures

Interviewers reported to their regional field managers or team leaders during prearranged team conference
calls. The purpose of these on-going calls was to answer any questions that the Interviewers may have had
and to monitor their progress. In addition, this time was used for planning approaches to specific cases,
discussing refusals and conversion strategies, describing tracking procedures, and discussing strategies to
meet the overall goals of the study. During the entire study period, but particularly the first weeks of the
study, production was monitored very closely.


Every interviewer's first household case in the spring data collection and in the fall data collection was
sent to their team leader. The case was thoroughly edited and evaluated and the household was also called
for verification of the interview. In addition to the first case, household cases could be flagged at any time
for evaluation and verification. If an interviewer was identified as having problems, all their cases could be
flagged for review.

## Coding and Data Entry


For every time diary coder, the first few diaries were check-coded by the head coder. After the initial
check, at least 10% of each coder's diaries was check-coded by the head coder.


The first 15 to 20 questionnaires (depending on the size of the questionnaire) of each data entry staff
person were reentered. The total number of eligible questions minus the number of mistakes was divided
by the number of eligible questions to determine each staff member's reliability score. If a staff member's
reliability score was below 98%, every questionnaire was reentered for verification. If the staff member's
reliability score was above 98%, approximately 20% of the questionnaires were reentered for verification.
The average reliability score for the data entry staff was 99.2%.
