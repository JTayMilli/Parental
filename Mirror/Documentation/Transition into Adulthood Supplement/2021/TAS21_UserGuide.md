## **Chapter 1 – An Introduction to TAS**

_**1.1 Background**_
Over the past several decades, the United States and other countries have seen a lengthening of the
period between childhood and adulthood—the “transition into adulthood.” Youth no longer move
quickly from secondary education into the labor force and independent economic living. Based on data
from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), less than 50 percent of individuals will form their own
independent family unit before they reach their mid-20s.


Scientists are becoming increasingly aware that the period between age 18 and 28 years are critical
for life span development. It is during this period that major investments are made in education,
crucial decisions are made regarding partnering and childbearing, and careers are planned and
initiated. For PSID, this means that important educational and occupational transitions are often
made while young adults are still dependent on their parents and are not primary respondents

themselves.

The Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) was launched in 2005 to follow sample members from
the original Child Development Supplement (CDS) cohort into young adulthood. The first six biennial
waves of TAS, from 2005 to 2015, focused exclusively on interviewing members of the original CDS
cohort as they passed through young adulthood. TAS was relaunched in 2017 with a new steady state
design and now follows all Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) sample members who are entering
early adulthood, and who comprise the future focal sample members of Core PSID. Information is
collected on many domains, including psychological functioning, family formation, fertility-related
behavior, cohabitation, childhood adversity, computer skills, responsibilities, employment and income,
education and career goals, and health. TAS enables a variety of research designs to study the wellbeing of young adults over historical and developmental time in family, school, and neighborhood

context.

_**1.2 The Original CDS and TAS Cohorts**_
The original Child Development Supplement began in 1997 as a cohort study. Children born between
1984 and 1997 who were aged 0 to 12 years in 1997 were eligible for CDS-1997. Up to two age-eligible
children per family were selected to participate. In 2002, a second wave of the original CDS collected
data on sample members when they were aged 5 to 17 years. In 2007, the third and final wave of the
original CDS was conducted with children aged 10 to 17 years.

The oldest members of the original CDS cohort had entered adulthood by 2003 and were ineligible for
CDS-2007. Instead, they were included in the earliest waves of the original Transition into Adulthood
Supplement. The original TAS began in 2005 to follow original CDS participants as they entered
adulthood. The first wave included 745 participants who were aged 18 to 20 years. Each subsequent
wave included interviews with previous respondents and added original CDS participants who had
entered adulthood in the preceding two years. By 2013, the original TAS included respondents who
were between age 18 and 28 years.


_**1.3 Ongoing CDS and TAS**_
All members of the original CDS cohort had entered adulthood by 2014. In that year, children in active
PSID families who were born since 1997 were invited to participate in a new, ongoing Child
Development Supplement. In contrast to the original CDS cohort, the new, ongoing CDS included all


7


children aged 0 to 17 years. Under the ongoing CDS design, children under age 18 years will be invited
to participate in a CDS interview about every five years. Sample children who have been born or
moved into a CDS family since the last wave of CDS are also eligible to participate.

Since 2017, TAS has also switched to a new, steady-state design. The ongoing Transition into Adulthood
Supplement now includes all eligible young adults aged 18 to 28 years in active PSID families regardless
of whether they had participated in the original or ongoing CDS. This new design adds young adults
who were eligible, but not selected, for the original CDS cohort; nonrespondent children from the
original CDS or the ongoing CDS; and young adults whose families joined PSID after 1997, including
families recruited as part of the 2017 PSID new immigrant refresher sample.

_**1.4 TAS-2021**_

TAS-2021 closely followed the content and design of the previous wave in 2019. In TAS-2019, a
randomly selected 80 percent of the TAS sample was given the option of completing their interview by
web with a telephone interview option available to respondents who did not or could not complete
their interview by web. The remaining 20 percent of the TAS sample was assigned to the telephone
mode and were not provided the option of a web interview. In TAS-2021, all sample members were
assigned to the web mode, but had the option to complete the interview on telephone; nearly 95
percent of the sample completed their TAS-2021 interview by web.

_**1.5 Core PSID**_

CDS and TAS are embedded in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world’s longest-running
nationally representative household panel survey. Since 1968, PSID has collected data on family
composition changes, housing and food expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment,
income, wealth, time spent in housework, health, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 84,000
people have ever participated in the panel, which includes up to seven generations within a family.
PSID is considered one of the most important longitudinal and intergenerational studies in the world.

PSID was conducted annually between 1968 and 1997 and biennially since 1999. PSID has collected data
on individuals and families that emphasize the dynamic and interactive aspects of family economics,
demography, and health. When paired with CDS and TAS, the design and content of PSID enable
research on the intergenerational influence of family on child and young adult outcomes and on how
childhood and young adulthood shape later health and well-being.

TAS thus serves as a “bridge of information” between the in-depth data collected in the CDS on the
years between birth and age 18 years, and the rich data collected in the PSID on the years after
economic independence is established.

## **Chapter 2 – An Overview of TAS Questionnaire Content**

The TAS-2021 questionnaire comprises ten sections, each of which represents a specific area of
interview content. A summary of each section is provided below.

_**Section A: Community Engagement and Technology Use**_
Questions in Section A focus on involvement over the last 12 months in the community including
volunteering and community service, group organizations, and sports participation, as well as the type of
organization and frequency of participation. A question series on technology use asks about the access
and ownership of cell phones, computers, tablets, and the internet. Frequency and type of technological

use is also collected.

Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not re-asked questions that were asked in their 2021 Core PSID interview.

_**Section B: Family Relationships, Personality, and Mental Health**_
Section B assesses the individual’s relationship with his or her parents. Respondents were also asked a
series of questions assessing emotional, psychological, and social well-being. These series include the
‘Big 5’ personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism),
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) on depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)
assessment. Questions also include self-rated levels of skill in areas such as leadership, intelligence,
independence, confidence, and problem solving, as well as self-rated worries and discouragement.

The level of responsibility that the respondent assumes for living arrangements and money
management including earning their own living, making rent or mortgage payments, paying their
bills, and managing their personal finances is also assessed. Respondents were asked to rate their
abilities to manage their money and solve day-to-day problems. Information about living
arrangements during a typical school year and during the summer was also collected.

Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not re-asked questions that were asked in their 2021 Core PSID interview.

_**Section C: Interpersonal Relationships**_

This section obtains information about the current marital and cohabitation status of the individual

and subjective evaluations of all romantic/intimate relationships through questions about living
arrangements, general satisfaction with relationships, time spent with partner, future expectations of
relationship duration, and the likelihood of marriage and divorce. Information was collected on past,
present, and future childbearing and fertility expectations, gender roles, biological/adopted child
rearing/family values, and parenting skills and experiences. Questions regarding gender identity and

sexual orientation are also asked in this section.

Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not re-asked questions from their 2021 Core PSID interview about when they
were widowed or when they were divorced.


9


_**Section D: Employment, Military Service, and Time Use**_
Section D collected detailed information about current employment status and all types of
employment and money-earning activities for the previous two years. Measures included salary/wages,
hours, experience, and size and type of the employer, reasons for being unemployed and/or not
working, as well as the methods and frequencies of job hunting. Moreover, detailed information was
collected about service in any branch of the Armed Services, along with self-rated satisfaction with
military service.

Information about how individuals spent their time during the past 12 months was collected including
time spent on leisure activities, computer/internet use, and community engagement. Certain items
from the CDS Primary Caregiver Child file were asked, permitting time-series analysis of activity
patterns in organized arts and sport, TV watching, reading, and computer use.

_**Section E: Past Year Income and Financial Help**_
Information was collected on income earned during the previous calendar year from multiple
sources, including unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, dividends, interest, trust
funds, child support, welfare, as well as financial help received from parents and other relatives for
daily living expenses, larger monetary gifts, and inheritances.

Respondents living with their parents or away at college are asked all questions in these sections;
respondents living on their own were only asked the latter questions pertaining to financial help, gifts,
and wealth because their income and business holdings information was gathered in their 2021 Core

PSID interview.

_**Section F: Wealth**_

A series of questions estimating the net value of automobiles, stocks and bonds, checking and
savings accounts, life insurance policies, and any other assets and investments were asked.
Information was also collected about student loans, credit card balances, and other debts.


_**Section G: Education**_

A key marker of the transition into adulthood is attainment of post-secondary educational degrees,
which, in turn, feed into work plans and career aspirations. In Section G, information was gathered
about the amount, dates, and location of education, starting with high school completion or GED
attainment, high school grade point average (GPA), and experience with college entrance exams.
Respondents were asked if they had ever attended or are currently attending college and, if not, the
reason for not attending.

_**Section H: Health**_

Section H includes a measure of self-rated overall health and whether respondents have ever been
diagnosed with a series of chronic illnesses/conditions such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension,
cancer, any mental health condition, and learning disabilities. The section includes a short series of
questions about psychological distress (K-6) during the past 30 days. These questions are also asked in

the Core PSID instrument.

In Section H, questions were asked about routine visits to the doctor and dentist, maintenance of a
healthy body weight, and engagement in a number of lifestyle practices such as exercising, eating


10


balanced meals, tobacco use, binge drinking, the use of illegal drugs or misuse of prescription
medicines, and unprotected sex.

For TAS respondents who were also a PSID Reference Person or Spouse/Partner, the first part of the
section was skipped and the section started with questions about health behaviors to avoid repeating

items that were collected in the Core PSID interview.

There is no Section I or J in the TAS-2021 Questionnaire.

_**Section K: Discrimination, Peer Influence, Risky Behavior**_
Section K includes questions addressing everyday discrimination, peer influence, assault, risky
behavior, and encounters with the law. Day-to-day encounters with discrimination are measured by
asking about frequency of experiencing specific types of discrimination. If any experience was
endorsed as happening more than once a year, the perceived reason for the discriminatory experience

was asked.


Peer influence was assessed using a set of questions about characteristics of friends with respect to
school and work-related activities, community involvement, and general outlook and attitudes about the
future. The frequency of engaging in dangerous, risky, and sensation seeking behaviors over the prior six
months was assessed, included fighting, damaging property, and drunk driving. Incidents of arrest,
probation, and jail time were measured separately through questions on when and why the offense(s)
occurred. Respondents were also asked about prior assaults, and the age at which an assault happened.

_**Section L: Religious and Spiritual Beliefs; Race and Ethnicity**_
Section L assesses current religious preferences and the importance of religion and spirituality in the
respondent’s life. Information was collected on race, ethnicity, ancestry, immigrant background,
languages spoken, English proficiency, and naturalization.

incorporation status and whether their employer is a public or private entity. Other changes include new
items to collect information about paid time off (PTO) and the number of weeks worked in the prior year.

_**Section E: Past Year Income and Financial Help**_
New content added to Section E in 2021 includes a module to collect information about changes in
employment experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic (ECOVID1-ECOVID10), stimulus payments
received (ECOVID20 and ECOVID21) and the Gig Economy (E3GIG1-E3GIG5).

_**Section F: Wealth**_

There were no content changes in the TAS-2021 instrument for Section F.


_**Section G: Education**_

Questions G15A and G15B replaced question G15 from TAS-2019, differentiating between current and
previous college attendance. Also new in 2021 is a section on internships (G27-G46).

_**Section H: Health**_

Questions HCOVID1A-HCOVID4YR ask about immunization status and whether a doctor diagnosed them
with COVID. Also new for TAS-2021 is a section that gathers information about the respondent’s transition
into adult health care and their medical home (H60A-H60K). A new generated scale measuring Adverse
Childhood Experiences (ACEs) includes subscales for Household Challenges and Abuse and Neglect is
included this wave.

_**Section K: Discrimination, Peer Influence, Risky Behavior**_
New content added to Section K includes questions K28-K30 and their accompanying generated
Loneliness Scale. A Sensation Seeking scale (SS2) is also new for TAS-2021 with the addition of

## **–** **Chapter 4 The TAS Sample**

Sample eligibility for TAS-2021 was defined by three criteria:

1. Born between 1993 and 2003. This meant that, in 2021, all eligible sample members were

between age 18 and 28 years;
2. Family participated in the 2021 Core PSID interview (either through their own interview as

Reference Person or Spouse/Partner or by identification as an “other family unit member”
in a household interview); and
3. Member of the PSID Sample, meaning that they are a lineal descendent (by birth or

adoption) of individuals who were living in an original PSID family unit from 1968 or a new
immigrant refresher family unit from 1997 or 2017.


_**4.1 Age Requirements**_
All eligible TAS respondents were identified and screened in the Core PSID interview. During the TAS
interview, respondents were asked to confirm their date of birth. If, during the TAS interview, it was
learned that the respondent was under age 18 years or over age 28 years, the respondent was coded
as non-sample (age ineligible).

_**4.2 Sample Size**_
A total of 2,719 PSID sample members aged 18-28 years were members of families who completed the
2021 Core PSID interview. These individuals were eligible for TAS-2021 and 2,362 completed a TAS2021 interview. Table 1 shows the distribution of the TAS-2021 sample, based on their participation in
the original CDS, ongoing CDS, or neither. Table 2 displays the TAS sample by year of collection,
including the ages of the individuals interviewed, the total sample sizes of each wave, and the
response rates over time.

## **Chapter 5 – Data Collection Procedures**

This chapter provides an overview of the data collection procedures for TAS-2021. In 2021, 2,719 ageeligible young adults were contacted for TAS following the completion of the Core PSID 2021 interview.

Data collection occurred over approximately ten months between September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022.
Respondents were contacted initially by an advance notification letter sent via postal mail, followed by
email and SMS text message requests throughout the field period to complete their interview.

At the end of the field period there were 2,362 completed interviews at an overall response rate of 88
percent (see Table 3). The average interview length was approximately 70 minutes, with about 40
percent of completed interviews provided by PSID respondents who also provided an interview in Core
PSID-2021, 52 percent by adult children who reside at home with PSID respondents, and 8 percent by
adult children living at college or university. Respondents were provided a post-paid incentive of $70 for
completing the interview.

## **–** **Chapter 6 The TAS-2021 Sample Weights**

This chapter provides a description of the sample weights for TAS-2021. There are two weights for TAS2021, a cross-sectional weight and a longitudinal weight. The cross-sectional weight accounts for unequal
selection probabilities due to the PSID sample design, while the longitudinal weight in a panel weight for
any TAS Respondent who was interviewed in the original CDS cohort, CDS-2014, TAS-2017 or TAS-2019.

_**6.1 TAS-2021 Cross-Sectional Weight**_
The TAS-2021 cross-sectional weight was designed to account for the unequal selection probabilities, due
to the original PSID sample design, and for differential eligibility and nonresponse. These weights were
also calibrated to selected demographic variables of the target population to further mitigate any
coverage and nonresponse error, and to improve the precision of survey estimates. We describe below the
three main components of the TAS-2021 cross-sectional weights.

_**6.1.1 Base weights**_
In order to account for differential selection probabilities and nonresponse during the PSID recruitment,
we used as base weights for TAS-2021 the 2021 PSID Individual Longitudinal Weights. However, due to
various eligibility criteria (including, for example, having to respond in PSID 2017 or 2019), not every
sampled individual at PSID 2021 that belongs to the TAS target population (individuals between age 18
and 28 years by December 31st, 2021) was eligible for TAS-2021. In order to account for this difference,
the base weights of such ineligible cases were re-distributed across the eligible sampled individuals, so
that the sum of the weights reflects, on average, the size of the target population.

_**6.1.2 Nonresponse adjustment**_
Unit nonresponse poses a threat to the quality of survey estimates as respondents and nonrespondents
might differ in terms of the study outcomes, which can ultimately cause nonresponse bias in such
estimates. If nonresponse follows a missing at random (MAR) mechanism (Little and Rubin, 2002), [1] this
nonresponse bias can be attenuated through certain statistical adjustments. To that end, a nonresponse
weighting adjustment was performed over the TAS-2021 data using a response propensity procedure. In
this approach, the weights are inversely proportional to an estimate of the probability of response to the
survey. These estimated probabilities of responding to the survey, also referred to as response
propensities, are computed using a logistic regression model of the survey response indicator over a set of
covariates available for both respondents and nonrespondents.

These sets of covariates are typically available for every sampled element. However, there are a few
cases in the TAS-2021 sample with missing values in some of these variables. Therefore, as a first step in
this nonresponse adjustment, we used regression-based single imputation to fill in the missing values in

those variables.

The probability that a sample person was a respondent in TAS-2021 was then estimated using a logistic
regression model. The dependent variable for this response propensity model is Y=1 if the eligible sample
person was a respondent in 2021 and Y=0 otherwise. The independent variables were respondent’s socioeconomic and demographic characteristics collected at PSID core, respondent’s Census Tract race
distribution (Black, API or other races) and poverty-related factors from principal component analysis
using respondent’s Census Tract data, as proposed by Sampson et al. (1997). [2] The estimated parameters
and standard errors for this logistic model are reported in Table 1. For example, the results indicate that
the log odds of response were significantly higher for females, significantly lower for institutionalized
OFUMs who were not in college, lower for members of the immigrant sample, and higher for those who
completed a high school diploma or GED and were pursuing higher education.

To reduce variation in response propensity weights and lower the reliance on correct model specification
of the logistic regression, 10 nonresponse adjustment classes were created based on deciles of the
predicted response probability (propensity score stratification; Little and Rubin, 2002) [1] estimated using
the logistic model in Table 4. The inverse of the unweighted mean predicted response probability for TAS2021 eligible sample cases in each decile was assigned as the nonresponse adjustment factor for that
weighting class. The nonresponse-adjusted weight for TAS-2021 respondents was computed as the product

of their base weights (2021 PSID Individual Longitudinal Weights adjusted by eligibility) and their
weighting class nonresponse adjustment factor.

_**6.1.3 Calibration**_

As the final step in weight development, the nonresponse-adjusted weights are used as input in a
calibration adjustment, in which the TAS-2021 sample weighted distribution are matched on selected
auxiliary variables to population totals estimated from the American Community Survey 2021 1-year PUMS
data for individuals between age 18 and 28 years by December 31st, 2021. If such variables are predictive
of the survey outcomes, this calibration adjustment can reduce non-sampling biases (such as coverage
and nonresponse) and improve the precision of the survey estimates. The following variables and
interactions were used in the calibration adjustment:


  - Sex (Male, Female)

  - Race/Ethnicity of reference person (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic While Alone, Non-Hispanic Black or
African American, Non-Hispanic Asian alone/AIAN/NHPI/Some other race alone, Non-Hispanic Two
or more races, non-institutional group quarters)

  - Household size (1, 2, 3, 4 or more, non-institutional group quarters)

  - Age (17-19, 20-22, 23-25, 26-28) by Family type and employment status (Married-couple family:
Husband and wife in Labor Force (LF); Married-couple family: Husband in labor force, wife not in
Labor Force; Married-couple family: Husband not in Labor Force, wife in Labor Force; Marriedcouple family: Neither husband nor wife in Labor Force; Male householder, no wife present, in
Labor Force; Male householder, no wife present, not in Labor Force; Female householder, no
husband present, in Labor Force; Female householder, no husband present, not in Labor Force;
non-institutional group quarters)

  - Household size (1, 2, 3, 4 or more, non-institutional group quarters) by Region (Northeast,
Midwest, South, West)

These dimensions were determined in previous waves of TAS based on their correlation with key survey
outcomes in order to optimize the nonresponse weighting adjustment to such variables. In order to avoid
undue increase in the variability of the weights, the following calibration cells with small sample sizes
were collapsed for the calibration procedure:


  - Age by Family type and employment status:

`o` Age groups: 17-19, 20-22, 23-25, 26-28
`o` Family type and employment status:

          - "Married-couple family: Husband not in labor force (LF), wife in LF" with "Marriedcouple family: Neither husband nor wife in LF"

          - "Other family: Male householder, no wife present, in LF" with "Other family: Male
householder, no wife present, in LF"

The calibration adjustment was performed using a raking ratio (or iterative proportional fitting) method
(Deming and Stephan, 1940) [3] through a SAS macro developed by Izrael, Battaglia and Frankel, 2009. [4] An
advantage of this SAS implementation is that apart from running the raking procedure to adjust the

weights to enforce the weighted sample distribution to match the population margins in the selected
calibration dimensions, it also simultaneously trims the weights according to trimming parameters, in
order to mitigate the increase of the sampling variance due to the weight variability. The final crosssectional weight for TAS-2021 respondents was derived from the output weights of this calibration
adjustment with trimming. Table 5 reports key summary statistics for the final TAS-2021 cross-sectional
weight. The TAS-2021 cross-sectional weight is stored in the variable TA212394.

_**6.2 TAS-2021 Longitudinal Weights**_
For TAS-2021 panel respondents who participated in CDS or in previous TAS waves, we provide a
longitudinal weight. This weight accounts for differential probabilities of selection due to the original
PSID sample design and subsequent attrition since initial selection.

The construction of this TAS-2021 longitudinal weight is described in the remainder of this section.

|26|Deceased|



_**6.2.1 Sample Transition from previous CDS and TAS waves to TAS-2021**_
The TAS-2021 respondents were originally selected for CDS-1997, CDS-2014 or CDS-2019 when they were
age 2–12 years, or in TAS-2017 or TAS-2019. From all of those who participated in these CDS or TAS
waves, 3,372 were projected to be eligible for participation in TAS-2021. For these 3,372 cases, Table 6
summarizes the final contact and interview dispositions in TAS-2021. Among the projected eligible
sample, which excludes deceased (n=26) and non-sample individuals (n=41), a total of 2,233 interviews
were completed, resulting in a cumulative unweighted response rate of 67.6 percent (i.e.,
2,233/(2,233+1,072) =0.676). [5] See Chapter 5 for a description of the TAS-2021 wave-specific response
rate (88 percent) and data collection procedures and outcomes.


5 The cumulative response rate is defined as a ratio of the number of cases that were successfully
interviewed in TAS-2021 to the number of cases that were projected to be eligible for TAS-2021 in the
baseline survey, excluding deceased and non-sample individuals.

_**6.2.2 Methodological Approach**_
Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal probabilities
of sample selection and non-response or data that is missing at random (MAR; Little and Rubin, 2002). [1]
These weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each observation is selected and,
conditional on selection, that individuals respond to the survey questions. With longitudinal data, this
joint probability at time _t_, where the study has started at _t_ -1 or earlier, can be expressed as the
following


_P(S_ _t_ _=1) = P(S_ _t-1_ _=1) * P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1),_ _(1)_

where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in the study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at time _t._
Under this quasi-random model of the survey response process, the probability of being a participant at
time _t_ is the product of the probability of participating in the previous period and the conditional
“probability” of responding in the current period. Because the first term on the right-hand side of
Equation _(1)_ is proportional to the reciprocal of the weight in the previous period, the weight in the
current period is a product of the weight in the previous period and the inverse of the probability of
response (the second term on the right hand side of Equation _(1)_ ). We will refer to _1/ P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-_

_1_ _[=1) ]_ [as the attrition adjustment factor. ]

To reduce variation in response propensity weights and lower the reliance on correct model specification
of the logistic regression, nonresponse adjustment classes are created by grouping the probability of
response (propensity score stratification; Little and Rubin, 2002) [1] and then the inverse of the mean
predicted probability of response of each adjustment class is used as the nonresponse adjustment factor

for that class.

_**6.2.3 Differential attrition adjustment**_
The TAS-2021 individual longitudinal weight was designed to account for the differential attrition
between the baseline CDS or TAS prior waves and TAS-2021. Thus, the TAS-2021 longitudinal weight is a
product of the base weight of the corresponding baseline survey the respondent entered the study (CDS1997, CDS-2014, CDS-2019, TAS-2017 or TAS-2019) and the attrition adjustment factor.

To obtain the attrition adjustment classes, the probability that a sample person was nonresponse in TAS2021 was estimated using a logistic regression model. The dependent variable for this nonresponse
propensity model is Y=1 if the eligible sample person was a nonrespondent in 2021 and Y=0 if they were a
respondent (see Table 6). The estimated parameters and standard errors for the logistic model of
nonresponse attrition are reported in Table 7 and summary statistics for the covariates are reported in

Table 8.

For the TAS-2021 attrition adjustment, ten nonresponse weighting classes were defined based on deciles
of the predicted response propensity [6] of the baseline survey to TAS-2021 attrition estimated using the
logistic model in Table 7. The inverse of the mean predicted response propensity for TAS-2021 eligible
sample cases in each decile was assigned as the nonresponse adjustment factor for that weighting class.
The nonresponse-adjusted longitudinal weight for TAS-2021 was constructed as the product of the base
weight of the corresponding baseline survey the respondent entered the study and their weighting class


6 The predicted response propensity is calculated as the complement of the predicted nonresponse
propensity resulted from the logistic model in Table 7. That is, predicted response propensity = (1predicted nonresponse propensity).

_**6.2.4 Calibration**_

Similar to the TAS-2021 cross sectional weights, in the final step in the weight development the newly
constructed TAS-2021 nonresponse-adjusted longitudinal weight was calibrated to match population
totals estimates from the American Community Survey 2021 1-year PUMS data for individuals between age
18 and 28 years by December 31st, 2021 on selected auxiliary variables. The same set of auxiliary


24


variables and interactions and calibration method used in the calibration adjustment for the crosssectional were used for the longitudinal weights. Table 9 reports key summary statistics for the final TAS2021 longitudinal weight for prior CDS/TAS participants.

To examine the properties of the TAS-2021 longitudinal weight for prior CDS/TAS participants, we
compared weighted estimates for selected demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in the
baseline survey data computed in two ways. The first set of estimates is based on the full baseline subsample that remained eligible for TAS-2021. The base weight of the baseline surveys was used to create
these estimates for the full TAS-2021 sample. The second set of estimates is based only on the TAS-2021
respondent cases and employs the TAS-2021 longitudinal weight that adjusts for longitudinal nonresponse
among the eligible cases in the TAS-2021 wave of data collection. The results are provided in Table 10
and show that the distributions of the selected characteristics are similar across the two groups,
suggesting that the attrition adjustment for the TAS-2021 weight compensates for potential attrition bias
for variables included in the analysis. It is important to note, however, that this comparison does not
necessarily rule out the possibility of selection bias associated with other characteristics of the
respondents.

The TAS-2021 longitudinal weight for prior CDS/TAS participants is stored in the variable TA212395.

## **Chapter 7 – PSID Data Resource**

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative
sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning over five decades of data collection, contains
over 95,000 variables on a diverse set of topics, including the dynamics of family composition change,
marital and birth histories, housing, income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of family
members, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 84,000 individuals have ever participated in the
panel, which includes up to seven generations within a family.

PSID is the longest running panel on family and individual (including child) dynamics and has achieved
wave-to-wave reinterview response rates of 93-95 percent in recent waves. More information about
the study and its instruments can be obtained from its website:


[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx)


The PSID’s online bibliography provides references to studies using the data for many research topics
(including a keyword index):

[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/Search.aspx](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/Search.aspx)


For TAS data users, the rich family data in the core PSID provide a valuable opportunity to explore the
effects of family environmental factors in analyses of young adult outcomes. For a more comprehensive
[look at the PSID, please see the PSID-2021 User Guide:](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/data/Documentation/UserGuide2021.pdf)

_**7.1 PSID and CDS-TAS Data Center Files**_

Most of the family and individual-level data from all waves of the PSID, CDS, and TAS are available
through PSID’s Online Data Center. There are [tutorials that provide a guided overview to using the](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/VideoTutorial.aspx)
data. Customized data sets and codebooks can be generated through the easy-to-use PSID Online
Data Center: [https://simba.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx. For data users interested primarily or solely](https://simba.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx)
[in data from TAS and CDS, a separate CDS-TAS Online Data Center is available: http://cds-tas.org/.](http://cds-tas.org/)

_**7.2 Data Files – Individual, Family, CDS, and TAS**_
In the PSID Online Data Center, data are grouped by PSID main study data and by CDS and TAS data.
Within the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family-level files. The
individual-level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data. The family-level files include
not only “raw” interview data but also complex generated variables on income, work, wealth, sample
weights, and other measures. Data, by wave of the study, are provided as the next level within each of
the data groupings. In the CDS and TAS data group, the data are clustered by child-level files, which
include all of the interview modules, and by time diary activity files, which are at the activity level.
