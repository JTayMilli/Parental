TA212001, TA212002 and TA212003 make the subscale for Parent #1 while these 4 items

H83a. Now I would like to ask you some questions about how you have been feeling in the
past month. During the past 30 days, how often did you feel nervous?
Would you say all of the time, most of the time, some of the time, a little of the time,

or none of the time?

This variable is a component of the Non-Specific Psychological Distress-K6 Scale

(TA212321).

This scale is the sum of all non-missing responses to 6 items, where a score of 13 or

higher indicates sensitivity around the threshold for the clinically significant range of

the distribution of nonspecific distress.

TA212069   H83a  How Often Felt Nervous in Past Month

TA212070   H83b  How Often Felt Hopeless in Past Month

TA212071   H83c  How Often Felt Restless in Past Month

TA212073   H83e  How Often Felt Too Sad in Past Month

TA212074   H83f  How Often Felt Worthless in Past Month

To create the scale, the items are rescored as follows:

A response of

'All of the Time' = 4 points

'Most of the Time' = 3 points

'Some of the Time' = 2 points

'A Little of the Time' = 1 point

'None of the Time' = 0 points

The scores are then summed; a score of 13 or higher indicates sensitivity around the

threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific

distress.

This variable may be based on fewer than the above six variables. Items containing "don't

know" and "refused" responses are not included in the calculation of the scale.

In addition to the K-6 Scale components, item H83g. measures the magnitude of effect on

daily life.

This scale was developed by Dr. Ronald Kessler, Professor of Healthcare Policy at Harvard

Medical School.

TA212072  "H83D HOW OFTEN FELT EVERYTHING EFFORT"        NUM(1.0)

H83d. (During the past 30 days, how often did you...)
Feel that everything was an effort?
(Would you say all of the time, most of the time, some of the time, a little of the time,

or none of the time?)

This variable is a component of the Non-Specific Psychological Distress-K6 Scale

(TA212321).

This scale is the sum of all non-missing responses to 6 items, where a score of 13 or

higher indicates sensitivity around the threshold for the clinically significant range of

the distribution of nonspecific distress.

TA212069   H83a  How Often Felt Nervous in Past Month

TA212070   H83b  How Often Felt Hopeless in Past Month

TA212071   H83c  How Often Felt Restless in Past Month

TA212072   H83d  How Often Felt Everything an Effort in Past Month

TA212073   H83e  How Often Felt Too Sad in Past Month

TA212074   H83f  How Often Felt Worthless in Past Month

To create the scale, the items are rescored as follows:

A response of

'All of the Time' = 4 points

'Most of the Time' = 3 points

'Some of the Time' = 2 points

'A Little of the Time' = 1 point

'None of the Time' = 0 points

The scores are then summed; a score of 13 or higher indicates sensitivity around the

threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific

distress.

This variable may be based on fewer than the above six variables. Items containing "don't

know" and "refused" responses are not included in the calculation of the scale.

In addition to the K-6 Scale components, item H83g. measures the magnitude of effect on

daily life.

This scale was developed by Dr. Ronald Kessler, Professor of Healthcare Policy at Harvard

Medical School.

TA212204  "K9A HOW OFTEN DID SOMETHING DANGEROUS"        NUM(1.0)

K9a. Now please think about the last 6 months.
About how often in those 6 months did you do something you knew was dangerous just for the

thrill of it?

Would you say never, once, 2-3 times, 4-6 times, 7-10 times, 11-20 times, or 21 or more

times?

This variable is a component of both the Risky Behaviors Scale (TA212324) and Sensation

Seeking Scale (TA212325). The Risky Behaviors scale is the average of all non-missing

responses to these 5 items. The items are each scored 1-7 where higher scores are

indicative of more risk taking:

TA212204   K9a  How Often Did Something Dangerous

TA212206   K9b  How Often Damaged Public Property

TA212207   K9c  How Often Got into Physical Fight

TA212208   K9d  How Often Drove When Drunk or High

TA212209   K9e  How Often Rode with Drunk Driver

The Senation Seeking Scale is the average of non-missing values for these 2 items. The

items are each scored 1-7 where higher values indication more sensation seeking behaviors.

TA212204   K9a  How Often Did Something Dangerous

TA212205   K9a2 How Often Did Something Exciting

The origin of the scales are from MSALT Risky Behaviors, Slater, M. D. (2003).

Alienation, aggression, and sensation seeking as predictors of adolescent use of violent

film, computer, and website content. Journal of communication, 53(1), 105-121.

noted.

TA212383  "SCALE: BODY MASS INDEX"               NUM(4.1)

Body Mass Index

This variable was calculated as follows:

BMI =[(Weight in Pounds) / (Height in inches) x (Height in inches)] x 703

Height and weight values were taken from the following questions:

TA212063   H77.   Weight--Total Pounds

TA212065   H78.   Height--Feet Component

TA212066   H78.   Height--Inches Component

Any extreme results, i.e., BMI of less than 15.0 or greater than 59.9, were recoded to 99,
since in such cases the accuracy of height and/or weight values is highly doubtful.

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to

both adult men and women. BMI categories are:

Normal weight = 18.5-24.9

Overweight = 25.0-29.9

Obese = BMI of 30.0 or greater

Beale-Ross Rural-Urban Continuum Code for Residence at the Time of the TA Interview

This variable is suppressed (filled with zeroes) in the public release file to protect the

anonymity of respondents. The data are available in a separate file to qualified users

under special contractual arrangements with the PSID; for more information, contact us at

PSIDhelp@umich.edu.

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes against the 2013

Rural-Urban Continuum Codes published by USDA downloaded from

https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/.aspx

The 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes

metropolitan counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan

counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area. The official Office of

Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three

metro and six nonmetro categories. Each county in the U.S. is assigned one of the 9 codes.

This scheme allows researchers to break county data into finer residential groups, beyond

metro and nonmetro, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that are

related to population density and metro influence. The Rural-Urban Continuum Codes were

originally developed in 1974. They have been updated each decennial since (1983, 1993,

2003, 2013), and slightly revised in 1988. Note that the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes

are not directly comparable with the codes prior to 2000 because of the new methodology

used in developing the 2000 metropolitan areas.
