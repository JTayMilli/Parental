## **Chapter 1 – An Introduction to the TA study**

In the past several decades, the U.S. and other countries have seen a lengthening of the period
between childhood and adulthood—the “transition into adulthood.” Youth no longer move quickly from
secondary education into the labor force and independent economic living. Based on data from the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), less than 50% of individuals will become a head of their own
PSID family (or the spouse of a head—henceforth called the “wife”) before they are 24 years of age.


Scientists are becoming increasingly aware that the period between the ages of 18 and 24 years are
critical for life span development. It is during this period that major investments are made in
education, and careers are planned and initiated. For the PSID, this means that important educational
and occupational transitions are often made while young adults are still dependent on their parents,
many years before they become family heads and wives themselves.


The “CDS Youth’s Transition into Adulthood” (TA) study is part of PSID and its Child Development
Supplement (CDS). Although PSID collects some information about everyone who is a co-resident
member of each family in the study, the greatest detail is collected on the head and wife. Without the
TA study, this design would result in a large gap in information about the youth experiences of the CDS
cohort between their last CDS interview in adolescence and their first interview as a PSID head or

wife—in other words, there would be a gap in information about early adulthood transitions. The
launching of the TA study was motivated by recognition that these years are marked by choices,
changes, and transitions that have profound life-long consequences, but would be missed by the sample
design of the PSID prior to 2005. The TA study was initiated in 2005 to bridge this gap. The TA study
has since been collected in 2007 and 2009, and will be collected biennially in parallel to the PSID data

collection until at least 2015.


Based on current literature and theories guiding research on the adult transitional years, we designed
an interview that built on the information collected from these children when they were interviewed
as adolescents in CDS-II and CDS-III, and at the same time, harmonized and coordinated with data to be
collected on them when they are interviewed as adults in future waves of the core PSID.


To fully understand the TA study, one must be familiar with the core PSID and CDS data collection
projects. Therefore, a brief description of the design and content of the PSID and the CDS is provided.


The Panel Study of Income Dynamics is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of
U.S. families. Since 1968, PSID has collected data on family composition changes, housing and food
expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment, income, wealth, time spent in housework,
health, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 60,000 people have ever participated in the
panel, which includes up to four generations within a family. PSID is the longest running panel on
family dynamics and is considered one of the most important data archives in the world.


The PSID now is conducted every other year by telephone with data collection commencing in March
and ending by December of odd-numbered years.


5


In 1997, PSID supplemented its main data collection with additional data on a sample of 0-12 year-old
children in the study and their parents. The objective of this supplement – the Child Development
Supplement (CDS) – was to provide researchers with a comprehensive, nationally representative, and
longitudinal data base of children and their families with which to study the dynamic process of early
human capital formation.


The data collection activities for CDS-I, II, and III were quite extensive. Within the context of family,
neighborhood, and school environments, CDS gathered information about a broad array of
developmental outcomes including (but not limited to) physical health, emotional well-being, cognitive
abilities, achievements, and social relationships with family and peers. Each CDS child could have up
to eight modules of data collected from three different family members (primary and secondary
caregivers and the target child) and a school information source (teacher and/or school administrative
data).


Because CDS is a supplement to the PSID, the study takes advantage of an extensive amount of family
demographic and economic data about the CDS child’s family, providing more extensive family data
than any other nationally-representative longitudinal survey of children and youth in the U.S.


_**Bridging the Gap**_


Across the three waves of CDS, the study has collected data on children and youth aged 0-18 years.
CDS youth will eventually become the future “active panel” of the core PSID when they move out of or
“split-off” from their parents’ home and establish a household of their own. Under the current design
of the TA study, CDS youth will participate in three rounds of TA data collection and then, at around
age 25 years, will join the core PSID and participate in the study every other year from that point

forward.


Thus, the Transition into Adulthood Study (TA) serves as a “bridge of information” between the rich
data collected in the CDS on the years between birth and age 18 years, and the rich data collected in
the PSID in the years after economic independence is established (at around 25 years of age for most
individuals).

# **Chapter 2 – An Overview of TA File Structure**

The TA questionnaire is separated into 12 sections, each of which represents a specific area of
interview content. A summary of each section is provided below.


_**Section A: Time Use**_


As individuals move from adolescence into adulthood, they are confronted with new choices in how to
use their discretionary time. The concept of community additionally takes on a broader meaning and
opens up opportunities for increased integration in a larger social context. In Section A, we measure
time spent on a selected number of leisure activities, computer use, and community engagement. The
items that ask about involvement in organized arts and sport, TV watching, reading, and computer use
are items repeated from the CDS, permitting time-series analysis of activity patterns in these areas. In
other sections we also ask about time spent in other activities as well as time spent with friends,
family, and romantic partners. The questions in this section ask about frequency of participation in the
past 12 months.


_**Section B: Responsibilities**_


In this brief section, we assess the level of responsibility that the respondent assumes for living
arrangements and money management including earning their own living, paying rent or mortgage,
paying their bills, and managing their money. Respondents are asked to rate their abilities to manage
their money and solve day-to-day problems.


In addition, information about living arrangements during a typical school year and summer is
collected. For those respondents who spent most of their time living at their parents’ home, we ask
about the expected timing of moving out. Conversely, those living away at college or living on their
own are asked questions about the likelihood of moving back in with their parents.


_**Section C: Self**_


Section C consists of self-rated levels of skill in areas such as leadership, intelligence, independence,
confidence, and problem solving, as well as self-rated psychosocial measures on worries and
discouragement.


_**Section D: Marriage, Family, and Relationships**_


This section measures the current marital and cohabitation status of the individual and subjective
evaluations of all romantic/intimate relationships by assessing living arrangements, general
satisfaction, time spent with partner, future expectations, and the likelihood of marriage and divorce.
Information is collected on past, present, and future pregnancies and fertility expectations, gender
roles, child rearing/family values, and parenting skills and experiences. The relationship the individual
has with his or her own parents is measured to continue collecting measures from the CDS.


Those respondents living at home or away at college are asked all questions in this section;
respondents living on their own are not asked questions about when they were widowed, when they
were divorced, and when they started living with the current partner as these questions are asked in
their main PSID 2009 interview.


7


_**Section E: Employment**_


This section collects detailed information on current employment status and all types of employment
and money-earning activities for the previous two years. Measures such as salary/wages, hours,
experience, and size and nature of the employer, reasons for being unemployed and/or not working, as
well as the methods and frequencies of job hunting are all obtained. Moreover, detailed information
about service in any branch of the Armed Services is collected, and self-rated satisfaction measures are

obtained.


Respondents living at home or away at college are asked all questions in this section; however, those
living on their own are only asked the latter questions pertaining to involvement in the Armed Services
as their past and present work status is obtained in their main PSID 2009 interview. Specific question
objectives are provided on the next page.


_**Sections F and W: Income and Wealth**_


In Section F, we attempt to identify income earned the previous year from a number of other sources,
including unemployment compensation, workers compensation, dividends, interest, trust funds, child
support, welfare, and gifts. We also ask about financial help received from parents and other
relatives. A short series of questions that estimates net worth in automobiles, stocks and bonds,
checking and savings accounts, life insurance policies, and any other assets and investments is asked.
Information on student loans, credit card balances, and other debts is also collected.


Respondents living with their parents or away at college are asked all questions in this section;
respondents living on their own are only asked the latter questions pertaining to wealth as their income
and business holdings information is gathered in their main PSID 2009 interview.


_**Section G: Education and Career Goals**_


A key marker of the transition into adulthood is attainment of post-secondary educational degrees,
which, in turn, feeds into work plans and career aspirations. Some young adults, however, may choose
an alternative route to a traditional college track, such as a military career (see Section E) or
vocational training.


In Section G, we gather information about the amount and dates of education, starting with high school
completion or GED attainment, high school GPA, and experience with college entrance exams. We ask
if the respondent ever attended or is currently attending college. For those who have had some college
experience, we ask the following sequences:


Starting at G19 and G20, we gather details about vocational education, or any training that results in
skills and certification for jobs. We ask if the respondent ever took vocational education (in our
definition, this includes on-the-job training) and if the respondent is currently enrolled. For those
currently involved in vocational education, we ask about the amount of time spent per week in
training, type of training – whether through a vocational or business school, vocational rehabilitation,
or on-the-job training – and why the respondent enrolled in the training. Reasons for enrollment are
coded on the spot into four basic categories: for job advancement or promotion, as a job requirement,
for licensing or certification, or to help with obtaining future job.


In this section, as well as in the military sequence in Section E, we ask how education, vocational
training, military training, and current work experiences fit into overall career plans. We ask a series
of four items in each of the scenarios just mentioned that focus on:


8


(a) Satisfaction with current schooling/training/work;


(b) Whether the schooling/training/work is part of a long-term career plan;


(c) If the respondent thinks that the schooling/training/work will help in getting
a/another job; and


(d) If the respondent thinks that schooling/training/work will help in succeeding in
a/another job.


Toward the end of Section G, beginning at G30, we turn to a focus on future expectations in these
areas as well as work. We assess expectations for getting stable, well-paying jobs in the future and if
life for them will be more difficult than it was for their parents when their parents were their age. We
ask them to tell us the job they would like at age 30 – what type of work that it involves, why they
aspire to that job, how successful they feel they will be at this job, and the likelihood of actually
attaining it.


At G40 and G41, the respondent describes his or her strengths and weaknesses in a number of job skills
and characteristics of desirable jobs.


The path through Section G is fairly straightforward: respondents living at home and those away at
college are asked all questions in this section; however, those respondents living on their own are not
asked questions pertaining to their secondary education or graduation from high school, such as “when
did you receive your GED” or “what was the last grade you attended” because these items are already
collected in the main PSID interview.


_**Section H: Health**_


This section begins with a self-rated measure of the individual’s overall health and asks if he or she has
or has ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses/conditions such as asthma, diabetes,
hypertension, cancer, and any mental health condition. For each condition, we ask age when first
diagnosed and limitations on normal daily activities that result from the condition. We then ask a short
series of questions about psychological distress both in the past 30 days and past 12 months. These
questions are parallel to those asked in the main PSID instrument.


In young adulthood, individuals begin to take on more responsibility for maintaining their own health.
This task involves both routine visits to the doctor and dentist, maintenance of a healthy body weight,
and engagement in a number of lifestyle practices such as exercising, eating balanced meals, and
abstinence from smoking, binge drinking, and use of illegal drugs or misuse of prescription medicines.
In Section H, we ask about all of these activities.


The path through in Section H is more complicated than for other sections. Some, but not all, of the
questions in the TA interview are the same as those in the main PSID. For respondents living on their
own as PSID heads or wives, we skip the first part of the section and start with health behaviors to
avoid repeating questions that are collected in the main PSID interview.


_**Section K: Social Environment**_


Section K includes five distinct series of questions addressing everyday discrimination, peer influence,
assault, risky behavior, and encounters with the law.


9


Day-to-day encounters with discrimination are measured by asking about frequency of experiencing
specific types of discrimination. If one or more situations are endorsed, we ask the perceived reason
for the discriminatory experience.


Peer influence is examined through a set of questions about characteristics of friends with respect to
school and work-related activities, family and interpersonal relationships, community involvement, and
general outlook or attitudes about the future.


We ask about prior assaults, and age at which the event happened.


The items concerning dangerous and risky behaviors include fighting, damaging property, drunk driving,
and unprotected sex. We ask how often the respondent engaged in each behavior in the prior six
months. Incidences of arrest, probation, and jail time are measured separately through questions on
when and why the offense(s) occurred.


Respondents living at home, away at college, and living on their own all get the same set of questions

in this section.


_**Section L: Religiosity/Race & Ethnicity**_


In this brief section, we ask about current religious preferences and the importance of religion and
spirituality. The last two questions are asked of respondents living at home with their parents (those
living on their own get these two questions in their main PSID 2009 interview). Standard race and
ethnicity items from the Census are asked.


_**Section M: Outlook on Life**_


The TA interview ends with a short series of questions tapping into subjective evaluations regarding the
respondent’s self and society.


10


# **Chapter 3 – The TA Sample**

The TA-09 sample is defined by four basic components:


1. Age (18 years and older);
2. No longer attending high school;
3. Participation in CDS baseline interview (1997, 2002/2003, or 2007); and
4. Participation of main family in PSID 2009 interview.


_**Education and Age**_


The transition into adulthood developmental period is defined for this study as commencing when high
school ends and the individual reaches age 18 years. Former CDS participants who reached age 18
years in calendar year 2009 were contacted for an initial screener interview to determine if they would
complete a CDS or a TA interview.


_**Member in the CDS Cohort**_


All TA sample members had a completed family-level baseline interview at CDS-I in 1997. This means
that each TA sample member had information from the primary caregiver interview about the TA
individual when they were a child. The TA sample members may have also participated in an

educational assessment and a child interview.


_**Response in PSID 2009**_


Individuals were included in the TA-09 sample if they completed a PSID 2009 family interview.


Based on the sample definition, a total of 1,797 individuals were identified for the TA-09 survey. Due
to the concurrent data collection period for PSID 2009 and TA-09, some of the 1,797 cases were
identified after the data collection period ended and therefore were never released for field work.
Specifically, during the data editing process, 40 individuals who were initially thought to be ineligible
for the TA study because the main PSID 2009 family status was nonresponse, were discovered after the
interviewing period had ended to have in fact been eligible because they were residents in a PSID 2009
family that completed the interview.


The sample size released in the field for interviewing in three replicates for TA-09 was 1,599 cases (see
Table 1). During data collection, 18 cases were determined to be ineligible (incarcerated or deceased
respondents), and 1,599 were completed as interviews, resulting in a 92% response rate for the field
effort. [1] As a result of the editing and validation process for the main PSID 2009, the final count of
interviews with released data was revised to 1,554. Table 2 provides the final disposition for the total
sample of 1,797 cases, whether released for fieldwork or not.

# **Chapter 4 – The TA-09 Sample Weight**

To account for differential probabilities of selection due to the original PSID sample design and
subsequent attrition, the 2009 Transition into Adulthood (TA-09) data are provided with a sample
weight. The construction of TA-09 sample weight is described in this chapter.


_**Sample transition from CDS-I to TA-09**_


The young adults interviewed for the TA-09 study were originally part of the sample of PSID families
with young children who were selected and interviewed for the first wave of the Child Development
Supplement (CDS-I). Data collection for CDS-I was completed in 1997 among children 0-12 years old,
with most of the TA-09 young adults aged 8-12 years at that time.


In 1997, of the 3,563 children who participated in the original CDS-I interview, 1,916 would have been
projected to be eligible for participation in TA-09 (See Chapter 3). For these 1,916 cases, Table 1
provides their disposition in TA-09.


Among the projected eligible sample, which excludes deceased (n=4) and non-sample individuals
(n=24), 1,554 were complete interviews, resulting in a cumulative response rate of 81% (i.e., 1,554 /
(1,554 + 334) = 0.82). [2] See Chapter 5 for a description of the TA-09 wave-specific response rate (92%)
and data collection procedures and outcomes.

|Table 3. TA-09 Sample disposition (for weighting)|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|<br>|<br>|~~N ~~<br>|

|<br>|~~**Subtotal**~~<br>|~~334~~<br>|
|~~**Response**~~<br>|<br>|~~1,554~~<br>|
|<br>|~~**Subtotal**~~<br>|~~1,554~~<br>|
|~~**Total**~~||~~1,916~~|



_**Methodological Approach**_


Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal
probabilities of sample selection and non-response or data that are missing at random (MAR; Little and


2 The cumulative response rate is defined here as a ratio of the number of cases that were successfully
interviewed in 2009 to the number of cases that were projected to be eligible for TA-09 as of 1997,
excluding deceased and non-sample individuals.


13


Rubin, 2002). [3] These weights are inversely-proportional to the probability that each observation is
selected and, conditional on selection, that individuals respond to the survey questions. With
longitudinal data, this joint probability at time _t_, where the study has started at _t_ -1 or earlier, can be
expressed as:


P( _S_ _t_ _=_ 1) _=_ P( _S_ _t_ -1 =1 _) *_ P( _R_ _t_ =1 _|S_ _t_ -1 =1) _(1)_


where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in a study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at time _t._
The probability of being a participant at time _t_ is a product of the probability of participating in the
previous period and the conditional probability of being a respondent in the current period. As the
first term on the right hand side of _(1)_ is proportional to the reciprocal of the weight in the previous
period, the weight in the current period is a product of the weight in previous period and the inverse of
probability of response (the second term on the right hand side of _(1)_ ). We will refer to 1 / P( _R_ _t_ =1 _|S_ _t_ 
1 [=1) as the attrition-adjustment factor. ]


_**TA-09 Individual Weight**_


The TA-09 individual weight is designed to account for the differential attrition between CDS-I (in
1997) and TA-09, i.e. _t=_ 2009 and _t_ -1 _=_ 1997. Thus, the TA-09 weight is a product of the CDS-I weight,
i.e., the individual-level primary caregiver/ child weight (the weight variable named ‘CH97PRWT’), and
the attrition adjustment factor. [4]


To obtain the attrition adjustment factor, the probability that a sample person was non-response in the
TA-09 was estimated from a logistic regression model using observations from the Response and Nonresponse strata (see Table 1). The parameter estimates from this model are reported in Table 4 and
model summary and goodness-of-fit statistics are presented in Table 5. The results indicate that
attrition was higher among males and those whose head of household had a high school education. The
resulting attrition adjustment factor is an inverse of the predicted probability of successful reinterview, which is equal to one minus the estimated probability of non-response.

Sons, New York.

As the final step in weight development, the newly constructed TA-09 weight was truncated to reduce
the influence of extreme weight values on the variances of sample estimates of population statistics.
The cases with the weight values in the highest one percent and in the lowest one percent of the
weight distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th] and 1 [st] percentiles of the weight
distribution, respectively. Table 6 reports key summary statistics for the final TA-09 individual weight.

|Table 6. Summary Statistics|Col2|
|---|---|
|<br>|~~**2009 TA Individual**~~<br>**Weight**<br>|
|~~N~~<br>|~~1,554~~<br>|
|~~Minimum~~<br>|~~1.00~~<br>|
|~~Maximum~~<br>|~~72.61~~<br>|
|~~Mean~~<br>|~~17.55~~<br>|
|~~Standard~~|~~15.07~~|



To examine the properties of the TA-09 weight, we compared weighted estimates for some basic
demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in the CDS-I data—based on the CDS-I subsample that satisfy the eligibility requirements for TA-09 and weighted with the CDS-I sample weight—

to the estimates derived for the same variables measured in 1997 but based on the smaller TA-09

interview sample and weighted with the TA-09 weight. The results provided in Table 7 show that the
distributions of the selected characteristics are similar in the TA-09 eligible sub-sample of CDS-I and in
TA-09 interview sample, suggesting that the attrition adjustment for the TA-09 weight compensates
for potential attrition bias for variables included in the analysis. It is important to note, however, that
this comparison does not necessarily rule out the possibility of selection bias associated with other
characteristics of the respondents.


The final TA -09 weight is stored in the variable TA091001

# **Chapter 5 – Data Collection Procedures**

This chapter provides an overview of the data collection protocols for TA-09.


_**Contacting Respondents**_


The selected respondent was preloaded into a computer-based sample management system. Prenotification letters announcing the study and a respondent booklet was sent to all eligible sample
members. The respondent booklets were not always used—for example, the respondent booklet was
not used if it was unavailable (either had not arrived, or was misplaced).


Busy schedules, caller ID, and cell phones were the main obstacles in reaching and scheduling
interviews with these young adults. In order to maximize our chances of making contact, we amended
our fieldwork procedures to accommodate the schedules and lifestyles of this group by offering a cell
phone reimbursement of $10 to offset the cost of extra minutes used to complete the interview by cell
phone. We authorized calls beyond the end of the last call window (9:00 p.m.) to reach respondents
who were not available until later in the day. We assigned one “night owl” interviewer in the Eastern
time zone to make late calls to the Mountain and Pacific zones to provide additional opportunities for
reaching these respondents. Finally, interviewers enlisted contact persons (usually parents) to help
determine the best time to reach respondents. In some instances, parents called respondents to let
them know to expect to hear from us so they would recognize and answer the call when viewed on

caller ID.


_**Quality Control**_


The Quality Control Plan for TA-09 consisted of three components: Certification, Verification, and
Evaluation. Certification in the form of a practice interview was completed immediately following the
Interviewer training and ensured that all field staff received appropriate training on the TA-09
interview instrument and were able to complete the interview professionally and according to the
study protocol. Verification of interview data was conducted via telephone calls to respondents who
are asked questions that were included in the interview so that the responses could be compared. And
Evaluation of the interviewers’ adherence to general interviewing techniques and study-specific
protocols was based on the review of taped interviews by data collection staff.


_**Respondent Payments**_


All respondent payments were handled by project staff using an internal system. Participants were
either paid by check or money order. Each respondent received $40 for the completion of an interview
and could also be paid and addition $10 as a reimbursement if their interview was done via cell phone.


_**Results of Data Collection Effort**_


  - Data collection response rate: 92%


  - Completed interviews: 1,559 of 1,797 released sample cases

# **Chapter 6 – TA Interview: Topical Guide**

This chapter highlights all new content in the TA-09 instrument. As in TA-05 and TA-07, the interview
content was subdivided into sections. For this wave of data collection, Sections A (Time Use), E
(Employment), and H and L (Health) were all updated. The details of all of the updates are listed

here.


_**Section A – Time Use**_


The variable A1_1 was added before the existing variable A1. This question is asked for respondents of
TA-09 who were also PSID Other Family Unit Members (OFUMs), and parallels the PSID 2009 addition.


**-**
**A1_1** We’d like to start by asking you about life in general. Please think about your life-as-awhole. How satisfied are you with it? Are you completely satisfied, very satisfied, somewhat
satisfied, not very satisfied, or not at all satisfied?


_**Section C – Self**_


Two new questions have been added that ask if and how the economic recession have changed the
respondent’s educational plans (C6, C7, and C7OS)


**C6 -** Has the current economic recession led you to change your educational plans?


[Yes, No, Doesn’t have educational plans]


**C7 -** How is that? (How has the current economic recession led you to change your
educational plans?)


[Dropped out of school, returned to school, postponed returning to school, stayed in
school, changed major or field of study, or took out new loans for school]


**C7OS** – Other response specified by respondent for question C7.


_**Section E – Employment**_


Questions were added to the TA-09 Questionnaire regarding past connections to the armed forces. The
following questions obtained detailed information about whether or not the respondent was previously
in the military, which branch, rank, and duration, as well as specifics on deployment and satisfaction
during their time in the armed forces:


**E71A** – Have you ever served (in any branch of the Armed Services)? (Note that this
does not include Reserve Officers’ Training Corps [ROTC])


**E72M – E87 –** Though these questions were previously asked of those who were
currently in the armed forces, they are now asked of those who previously

served as well.


20


**E77A –** [Have you been/Were you ever] deployed outside of the U.S.?


**E77B –** Was any of that time spend in Iraq or Afghanistan?


[Yes, Iraq; Yes, Afghanistan; Yes, both; No, neither)


Questions E77A–E77B were added in 2009, and obtain additional information regarding the past
locations of deployment for the respondents of the TA-09 sample.


_**Section F – Income**_


Three questions were added to the TA-09 income section to more closely match the PSID instrument.
They were asked of OFUMs only, and refer to t-1 work income. They are as follows:


**F1 -** We try to understand how people all over the country are getting along financially,
so now I have some questions about earnings and income. How much did you
earn altogether from work in [PYEAR], that is, before anything was deducted for
taxes or other things, including any income from bonuses, overtime, tips, commissions,
military pay or any other source?


**F2 -** During which months of [PYEAR] did you get this income?


**F3 -** How is it that you worked, but did not receive earnings from it?


In addition to questions F38, F41, and F55 which ask about transfer income from the past year,
questions F38_2, F41_2, and F55_2 were asked to gather information on the month before the
interview. They are:


**F38_2 –** Thinking [ _OFUM:_ now] about last month ([PREVIOUS CALENDAR MONTH]), did you
receive any income last month from unemployment compensation?


**F 41_2 –** Did you receive any income last month ([PREVIOUS CALENDAR MONTH])) from workers
compensation?


**F55_2 -** (Did you yourself receive any income last month ([PREVIOUS CALENDAR
MONTH])) from Supplemental Security Income, TANF [or [State Program
Name]], formerly called ADC / AFDC, child support or other welfare?


Similar changes were made to questions F57A and F58A in order to parallel the PSID. These questions
refer to inheritances and/or large gifts received in the form of money or property. These questions are
asked in reference to the two years between the TA-07 and TA-09 interviews.


_**Section W – Wealth**_


In 2009 a sequence of questions was added about student loans. These questions ask about the

existence of and the amount of the loan(s). The questions are as follows:


**W45 –** Do you yourself currently have any student loans?


**W46 –** If you added up all of these loans, about how much would they amount to right
now?


21


**W47-** Would they amount to $2,000 or more?


**W48**   - Would they amount to $5,000 or more?


**W 49**    - Would they amount to $1,000 or more?


_**Section G – Education**_


For those who answered that they are not currently enrolled in college, questions G11A and G11AOS
were asked to gain insight into the reasons that the respondent either never enrolled in college or is no
longer attending college. The respondent is allowed to choose one or more of the following options
(provided in G11A), or specify their own reason if it did not fit into the choices offered.


**G11A -** We're interested in the reasons that people your age may or may not go to college. Can
you tell me the reasons that you are not currently enrolled in college?


[Already graduated from college, In vocational or technical school or training, Lack necessary
SAT / ACT scores or GPA, Can’t afford college, Not interested in (finishing) college,
Discrimination, Transportation problems, Family responsibilities, Can’t arrange child care,
Disability]


**G11AOS –** Other reason – specified as a string variable


_**Section H – Health**_


In order to parallel questions asked in the PSID, questions H1A, H1B, and H1C were asked to compare
the respondent’s health from their current status to their status two years ago. This question is asked
directly after H1, which asks “Now I have a few questions about your health. Would you say your health
in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” These additional questions continue as follows:


**H1A –** Compared to your health say, two years ago / _2005/2007 TA:_ Since we last
talked to you about your health], would you say that your health is better now,
about the same, or worse? [Better goes to H1B, Worse goes to H1C, About the
Same goes to H2]


**H1B –** Is it much better or somewhat better?


**H1C -** Is it much worse or somewhat worse?


These questions correspond to H1A, H1B, and H1C from the PSID Health section.


Another addition was variable H19A, which asks the specific year in which a major accident happened
in the respondent’s life (in reference to H19 – has a major accident in last two years).


_**Section K – Social Environment**_


In TA-05, TA-07, and TA-09, question K2 was asked about discrimination and perceived reasons for that
discrimination. In 2009, follow-up questions (K2A, K2B, and K2BOS) were asked to give the respondent
more than one chance to describe their views. Also, K2BOS was offered as an option to allow for


22


specified answers that were not included in the response list. The original question and answer options

for K2 are worded as follows:


K2 - We've talked about a number of things that may have happened to you in your dayto-day life. Thinking of those experiences which have happened to you, overall what do
you think was the main reason for the [DISCRIMINATION]? [Ancestry or natural origins,
Gender, Race, Age, Height or weight, Some other aspect of physical appearance]


The new variables continue directly after and are:


**K2A –** Are there any other reasons you think [this experience / these experiences]
happened to you?


**K2B –** What are those reasons? [Ancestry or natural origins, Gender, Race, Age, Height
or weight, Some other aspect of physical appearance]


**K2BOS -** Other reason – specified as a string variable


_**Coding of Variables**_


The 2000 Census Occupation / Industry codes (3-digit) were applied to the occupation and industry
reported in all completed interviews. There was an average of 2.2 instances of jobs per respondent.
Check coding was conducted on 10% of cases by a PSID staff member. The application used for coding
was developed and maintained by PSID staff.

# **Chapter 7 – PSID Data Resource**

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative
sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning almost four decades of data collection,
contains over 50,000 variables on a diverse set of topics, including the dynamics of family composition
change, marital and birth histories, housing, income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of
family members, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 70,000 individuals have ever participated
in the panel, which includes up to four generations within a family. The PSID is the longest running
panel on family and individual (including child) dynamics and has consistently achieved wave-to-wave
reinterview response rates of 96-98 percent. More information about the study and its instruments can

be obtained from its website:


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx


The PSID bibliography provides references to studies using the data for many research topics (key word
index provided):


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/Search.aspx


As a TA data user, the rich family data resource in the main PSID provides an incredible opportunity to
explore family environmental factors in your analyses of child outcomes. In this chapter, our goal is to
provide you with some basic (although not comprehensive) information about the PSID sample,
interview content, public and sensitive data contract file, and data structure. Let’s start first with an
overview of the sample origins and design.


_**The PSID Sample**_


The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from two independent samples: a nationally representative
sample of roughly 3,000 households designed by the Survey Research Center at the University of
Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and an over-sample of roughly 2,000 low income families from the Survey
of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO sample”). From 1968 to 1996, the PSID interviewed and reinterviewed individuals from families in these two samples every year, whether or not they were living
in the same dwelling or with the same people. Since 1997, interviewing has taken place every other
year. Also in 1997, the PSID added an immigrant refresher sample that was designed to incorporate into
the PSID a representative sample of immigrants who had moved to the U.S. since 1968.


The PSID follows adults through the full life course. Children born to an original-sample member are
classified as sample members and are eligible for tracking as separate family units when they set up
their own households. Adult sample members who move out of the PSID family units are tracked to
their new family units. This procedure replicates the population’s family-building activity and produces
a dynamic sample of families each year. New PSID families form when children grow up and establish
separate households. The unique self-replacing design implies that for many PSID families, the data
include self-reported information on three (and occasionally now, four) generations within the same
family at various points in their life course. Through multiple waves collected over long time periods on
a national population, the PSID is the only data set ever collected on life course and multigenerational
economic conditions, well-being, and health in a long-term panel representative of the full U.S.
population. Additional information about sample members and follow status can be found here:
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/FAQ.aspx#95](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/FAQ.aspx#95) Please note that PSID followed non-sample


24


parents of sample children from 1994-2003.

_**PSID Content**_

PSID contains a large number of variables that have been measured wave after wave using similar or
identical questions. Table 8 provides an overview of the content areas of PSID. The table indicates the
years for which variables were collected if they were not obtained in all waves. This table is not an
exhaustive description of the PSID content. Please see

_**Family and Individual Level Variables in the PSID**_

PSID variables can be categorized as family-level and individual-level. Most of the information from any
year’s data collection is categorized as **family-level variables** . The family-level variables include not
only information that applies to the family unit as a whole, but also almost all information about the
head and wife / “wife”. **Individual-level variables** are wave-specific data as well as time-invariant
information that may span many years. These variables cover basic demographic and economic data
about an individual in the study. If the individual was head or wife / “wife”, much of the information
in these variables is available among the family level variables, often in substantially greater detail.

_**The Building Blocks to Using PSID Data on Families & Individuals**_

Because of the complexity of the PSID data structure, and its long-panel nature, there are a few PSID
concepts that are important to understand to effectively take advantage of the richness of the data
archive. This section attempts to provide some background on these concepts.

We begin by providing the PSID definition of “family”. The **Family Unit (FU)** is defined as a group of
people living together as a family. “As a family” means that the individuals are generally related by
blood, marriage, or adoption—although unrelated persons can be part of an FU if they are permanently
living together and share both income and expenses. The **Household Unit (HU)**, on the other hand, is
defined as the physical dwelling, such as a house or apartment, where members of the PSID FU reside.
Not everyone living in a HU is automatically part of the FU. The PSID survey is about FU Members only.

Families change from year to year. Each family unit in a specific data collection wave is assigned a
unique **Family ID**, sometimes called “ **Interview Number** ”. The most critical Family ID is the one
assigned in 1968 to families in the original sample. According to our following rules, we follow “splitoffs” that occur when children and others set up their own independent households. Thus, one family
in 1968 could have become 3-4 or more families by 2009. All of these families will have the same 1968
ID, because they originated from the same family in 1968, but will have different family IDs in 2009
because they are separate family units in 2009.

For each family, the Family ID number will change from year to year. For example, a 1968 family ID of
1234 will not be 1234 in 1969 or any other year. Yearly IDs are assigned based on receipt-order of the
interview—the first interview received from field is numbered 1, the second, 2, and so on. In the table
on the next page, the “Smith Family” in 1968 had a Family ID of “0100” and included five FU members:
Jason and Andrea, and their three children Julie, Anne, and Todd:

|The “Smiths” in 1968|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Family Unit Member|Age|1968 Family ID|
|Dad (Jason)|36|0100|
|Mom (Andrea)|35|0100|
|Julie|12|0100|
|Anne|10|0100|
|Todd|8|0100|


By 2007, Jason and Andrea’s children had moved out on their own, thus creating four families out of
this original 1968 “Smith Family”. Notice each family keep their original 1968 ID, but also was assigned
unique 2007 Family ID:

|The “Smiths” in 2007|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Families|68 ID|2007 Family ID<br>“Interview Number”|
|Jason (Dad) & Andrea (Mom)|0100|0834|
|Julie, her husband and son|0100|1004|
|Anne|0100|0971|
|Todd, his wife and daughter|0100|2202|



The PSID collects information about the **individuals** in each FU. In the Data Center, each individual is
uniquely identified by their combined **1968 ID** (labeled as ER30001 in the Data Center) and **Person**
**Number** (labeled as ER30002). At the time of data release for each wave of the PSID, updates to Person
Numbers are made. This is important to remember because it will require data files that were
downloaded previously to be updated.

The most information is collected about the Head of the household, the second most about the wife (or
“wife” in the scenario of a cohabiter for one year or more), and the least amount of detail is collected
about other family unit members (OFUMs), who are oftentimes the children in the FU, but can also be
boy/girlfriends, grandparents, etc. All of the individuals in an FU have a **Relationship to the Head**
coded in the data files.

Within each wave of data, each FU has only one current Head. The person designated as Head may
change over time as a result of other changes affecting the family. When a new Head must be chosen,
the following rules apply:

The Head of the FU must be at least 16 years old and the person with the most financial responsibility
for the FU. If this person is female and she has a husband in the FU, then he is designated as Head. If
she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least one year, then he is Head. However, if
the husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the functions of Head, then the FU will
have a female Head.

A new Head is selected in situations such as:


� Last year’s Head moved out of the HU, died or became incapacitated; or


� A female Head has gotten married; or


29


� An individual or group of individuals split-off to form a new FU.

The **Wife** is the spouse of the head; **“Wife”** is the cohabiter of one year or more. Much of the
information collected in the PSID about Heads is also collected about the Wives and “Wives”.

Continuing with our Smith Family example, Julie was one of the original sample members in 1968. She
is the daughter of Jason, who was then the Head. In 2007, she was living in her own FU, Family ID
1004, with her husband and their child. Her relationship to Head is now Wife. Her husband is Head and
their son is Child of Head.

**Julie’s Family in 2007**

|2007 Family ID|68 ID|Individuals|Relationship to Head|
|---|---|---|---|
|~~1004~~|~~0100~~|Julie (original 1968<br>sample member)|~~20 (Wife to Head)~~|
|1004|0100|Husband|10 (Head)|
|1004|0100|Son|30 (Child of Head)|



**Other Family Unit Members (OFUMs)** are the other individuals living in the family unit. Not as much
information is collected about OFUMs as Heads and Wives. Generally, the PSID main interview provides
individual-level data on the OFUMs as well as data each wave about their:


� Demographic information, such as birth month and year, sex, date of death, family unit status,

wave-specific response status;


� Marital and fertility histories and cohabitation status;


� Work status, number of jobs, occupation, weeks worked on job, during which months of

previous year, hours per week;


� Other income sources – (interest, TANF, SSI, welfare, social security, unemployment

compensation, worker’s compensation, child support, help from relatives);


� (For OFUMs 16 years and older) highest grade or year of school completed;


� (For OFUMs 16-49 years of age) Date last attended school and whether currently enrolled as part
time or full time student; and


� Health insurance coverage.


Note that CDS “children” are OFUMs in the PSID data collections and are considered PSID individuals.

Data about them in the main PSID interviews can be merged onto CDS data files.

In CDS, the **primary and secondary caregivers are in relationship to the child** (variables “RELPCG07”
and RELOCG07” in 2007). If you are interested in merging data from PSID about the caregivers, it is
helpful to know the caregivers’ relationships to Head. In some situations, the data you are interested in
may have only been collected for Heads and Wives. This accounts for the majority of the PCG and
OCGs.

Keeping in mind the PCG’s Relationship to Head, if you are interested in constructing, for example, the
PCG average work hours, you will find that PSID asks for this information and stores it in three separate


30


variables depending on the individual’s relationship to head:

ER36170 BC43 On average, how many hours a week did you work on this job in 2006?-CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (HEAD)


ER36428 DE43 On average, how many hours a week did she work on this job in 2006?-CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (WIFE)


PSID has a self-replacing sample design whereby children are interviewed as their own family unit after
they leave their parents’ households and other adult sample members who move out of the family unit
are tracked to their new family units. With this design, at any wave, the PSID has main or “reinterview” families and split-off families. A **main or reinterivew family** is a family unit (FU) that was
interviewed in the prior wave. In the case of children leaving home, the main family is almost always
the parental family. A **split-off family**, on the other hand, consists of a person or group of people (at
least one of whom is a “followable” person of any age) who moved out from a main family since the
prior wave’s interview to form a new, economically independent family unit. Several criteria must be
met for a split-off to occur. In addition to having moved out since the prior wave and to being
“followable” (i.e., having an original 1968 family identification), the person or group of people have
not moved to an institution such as college or prison or to another family unit within the panel study.
Moreover, the person or group of people who have moved out and formed their own family unit must
be economically independent (i.e., they must be paying their own living expenses) from the family unit
from which they split off. Information that informs the criteria is gathered at the main family
interview, during the household listing stage. The main family respondent provides these details. Noted
that these are general rules and that sometimes unique situations arise that determine whether a
person or group of persons becomes a split-off. For example, while moving to an institution, such as
college, does not generally meet the criteria for becoming a split-off, if the person is working, paying
their own living expenses, and paying their own educational expenses in addition to attending school,
then this person would be considered a split-off. Information that can inform this type of scenario is
gathered in Section G of the main family interview and in the interviewer observations. The living
situation and interview data for each and every possible split-off case are first reviewed before splitoff status is granted.

_**Family Composition Change**_
When looking at variables pertaining to the same person(s) over time, the variable called “Sequence
Number” can be of help in understanding continuity and change in family composition from wave to
wave. The **Sequence Number**, found in the individual file, identifies an individual’s status within a
family unit at each wave of data collection. The sequence number has the following coding scheme:


1-20 Individuals who were in the family at the time of the current wave interview


51-59 Individuals who were in institutions at the time of the current wave interview


71-80 Individuals who moved out of the FU or out of institutions and established their own households

between the prior and current wave interview


81-89 Individuals who died by the current interview but were living at the time of the prior wave
interview.

PSID also has a variable (“ **Whether Moved In/Out** ”) to indicate whether the individual moved in or out
of a family unit in a given wave. The 2007 codebook definition below provides the coding for this


31


variable.

|1|Moved in or born between the 2005 and 2007 interviews; split-off in 2007|
|---|---|
|2|~~Appeared; moved in by the time the 2005 interview was taken but not included in FU for~~<br>2005 (i.e. listing error)<br>|
|5|~~Moved out of FU or out of an institution between the 2005 and 2007 interviews and was~~<br>not included in a 2007 panel FU|
|6|Moved out of FU and into an institution between the 2005 and 2007 interviews|
|7|Living in 2005 but died by the time of the 2007 interview<br>|
|8 <br>|~~Disappeared; moved out prior to the 2005 interview, but included in FU for 2005 (usually~~<br>a listing error)|



_**PSID Data Center Files**_
Most of the family and individual-level data on all waves of the PSID and CDS are housed in the online
PSID Data Center. There are tutorials that provide a guided overview to using the data. You can create
customized data sets and codebooks through the easy-to-use Data Center.


_**Data Files – Individual, Family, CDS, and TA**_
In the Data Center, you will find the data grouped by PSID main study data and CDS data. Within the
PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family level files. The individual
level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data, mentioned earlier in this chapter. The
family-level files include not only “raw” interview data but also complex generated variables on
income, work, wealth, sample weights, and other measures. Data, by wave of the study, are provided
as the next level within each of the data groupings. In the CDS data group, the data are clustered by
child-level files, which include all of the interview modules, and by time diary activity files, which are
at the activity level
