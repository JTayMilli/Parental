## **Chapter 1 – An Introduction to the TA study**

In the past several decades, the U.S. and other countries have seen a lengthening of the period
between childhood and adulthood—the “transition into adulthood.” Youth no longer move quickly from
secondary education into the labor force and independent economic living. Based on data from the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), less than 50% of individuals will become a head of their own
PSID family (or the spouse of a head—henceforth called the “wife”) before they reach their mid-20’s.


Scientists are becoming increasingly aware that the period between the ages of 18 and 28 years are
critical for life span development. It is during this period that major investments are made in
education, crucial decisions are made regarding partnering and childbearing, and careers are planned
and initiated. For the PSID, this means that important educational and occupational transitions are
often made while young adults are still dependent on their parents, many years before they become
family heads and wives themselves and official join the PSID sample as primary respondents.


The “Transition into Adulthood” (TA) study is part of PSID and a follow-on to the PSID Child
Development Supplement (CDS). Although PSID collects some information about everyone who is a coresident member of each family in the study, the greatest detail is collected on the head and wife.
Without the TA study, this design would result in a large gap in information about the youth
experiences of the CDS cohort between their last CDS interview in adolescence and their first interview
as a PSID head or wife. In other words, there would be a major gap in information about early
adulthood transitions. The launching of the TA study was motivated by recognition that these years are
marked by choices, changes, and transitions that have profound life-long consequences, but would be
missed by the sample design of the PSID prior to 2005. To bridge this gap, the TA study was initiated in
2005 when the oldest CDS respondents reached 18 to 20 years of age. The TA study has subsequently
been conducted in 2007, 2009, and 2011, and will be conducted biennially in parallel with the core
PSID until 2015 when the youngest individuals in CDS will have reached adulthood.


Based on current literature and theories guiding research on the adult transitional years, the TA
interview was designed to build on the information collected from these children when they
themselves were interviewed as adolescents in CDS-II and CDS-III, and, at the same time, harmonized
and coordinated with data to be collected on them when they are interviewed as adults in future
waves of the core PSID.


To fully understand the TA study, one must be familiar with the core PSID and CDS data collection
projects. Therefore, a brief description of the design and content of the core PSID and the CDS is
provided here.


The Panel Study of Income Dynamics is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative sample of
U.S. families. Since 1968, PSID has collected data on family composition changes, housing and food
expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment, income, wealth, time spent in housework,
health, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 60,000 people have ever participated in the
panel, which includes up to four generations within a family. PSID is the longest running panel on
family dynamics, and is considered one of the most important data archives in the world.


The PSID now is conducted every other year by telephone with data collection commencing in March
and ending by December of odd-numbered years.


5


In 1997, PSID supplemented its main survey with collection of additional data on a sample of 0-12 yearold children in the study and their parents. The objective of this supplement—the Child Development
Supplement—was to provide researchers with a comprehensive, nationally representative, and
longitudinal data base of children and their families with which to study the dynamic process of early
human capital formation. Two additional waves of CDS were conducted in 2002-2003 (CDS-II), when
the children were 5-17 years of age, and in 2007-2008 (CDS-III) for children in the cohort who were
under 18 years of age.


The data collection activities for CDS-I, II, and III were quite extensive. Within the context of family,
neighborhood, and school environments, CDS gathered information about a broad array of
developmental outcomes including (but not limited to) physical health, emotional well-being, cognitive
abilities, achievement, and social relationships with family and peers. Each CDS child could have up to
eight modules of data collected from three different family members (primary and secondary
caregivers and the target child) and a school information source (teacher and/or school administrative
data).


Because CDS is a supplement to the PSID, the study takes advantage of an extensive amount of family
demographic and economic data about the CDS child’s family, providing more extensive family data
than any other nationally-representative longitudinal survey of children and youth in the U.S.


_**Bridging the Gap**_


Across the three waves of CDS, the study has collected data on children and youth aged 0-18 years.
CDS youth will eventually become the future “active panel” of the core PSID when they move out of (or
“split-off”) from their parents’ home and establish an independent household of their own. Under the
current design of the TA study, CDS youth will participate in TA data collection until they reach age 26
years, regardless of whether they have become members of the core PSID. Whey they join the core
PSID, they will participate in that study every other year from that point forward.


The Transition into Adulthood (TA) Study thus serves as a “bridge of information” between the rich
data collected in the CDS on the years between birth and age 18 years, and the rich data collected in
the PSID in the years after economic independence is established.

## **–** **Chapter 2  An Overview of TA File Structure**

The TA questionnaire is separated into 12 sections, each of which represents a specific area of
interview content. A summary of each section is provided below.


_**Section A: Time Use**_


As individuals move from adolescence into adulthood, they are confronted with new choices about how
to use their discretionary time. In addition, the concept of community takes on a broader meaning and
provides opportunities for greater integration into a larger social context. In Section A, we measured
time spent on a selected number of leisure activities, computer use, and community engagement.
Certain items from the CDS were repeated, permitting time-series analysis of activity patterns in
organized arts and sport, TV watching, reading, and computer use. In other sections we asked about
time spent in other activities, as well as time spent with friends, family, and romantic partners. The
questions in this section asked about frequency of participation in the past 12 months.


_**Section B: Responsibilities**_


In this brief section, we assessed the level of responsibility that the respondent assumes for living
arrangements and money management including earning their own living, making rent or mortgage
payments, paying their bills, and managing their personal finances. Respondents were asked to rate
their abilities to manage their money and solve day-to-day problems.


In addition, information about living arrangements during a typical school year and during the summer
was collected. For those respondents who spent most of their time living at their parents’ home, we
asked about the expected timing of moving out. Conversely, those living away at college or living on
their own were asked questions about the likelihood of moving back in with their parents.


_**Section C: Self**_


Section C consists of self-rated levels of skill in areas such as leadership, intelligence, independence,
confidence, and problem solving, as well as self-rated psychosocial measures about worries and
discouragement.


_**Section D: Marriage, Family, and Relationships**_


This section obtained information about the current marital and cohabitation status of the individual

and subjective evaluations of all romantic/intimate relationships through questions about living
arrangements, general satisfaction with relationships, time spent with partner, future expectations of
relationship duration, and the likelihood of marriage and divorce. Information was collected on past,
present, and future childbearing and fertility expectations, gender roles, child rearing/family values,
and parenting skills and experiences. The individual’s relationship with his or her parents was
assessed, continuing the collection of measures from the CDS.


Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not asked questions about when they were widowed, when they were
divorced, and when they started living with the current partner because these questions were asked in
their 2011 core PSID interview.


7


_**Section E: Employment**_


This section collected detailed information about current employment status and all types of
employment and money-earning activities for the previous two years. Measures included salary/wages,
hours, experience, and size and type of the employer, reasons for being unemployed and/or not
working, as well as the methods and frequencies of job hunting. Moreover, detailed information was
collected about service in any branch of the Armed Services, and self-rated satisfaction with military

service was obtained.


Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; however, those
living on their own were only asked the latter questions pertaining to involvement in the Armed
Services because information about their past and present work status was obtained in their 2011 core
PSID interview. Specific question objectives are provided on the next page.


_**Sections F and W: Income and Wealth**_


In Section F, we attempted to identify income earned during the previous calendar year from a number
of other sources, including unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, dividends, interest,
trust funds, child support, welfare, and gifts. We also asked about financial help received from
parents and other relatives. A short series of questions that estimated the net value of automobiles,
stocks and bonds, checking and savings accounts, life insurance policies, and any other assets and
investments was asked. Information was also collected about student loans, credit card balances, and

other debts.


Respondents living with their parents or away at college were asked all questions in this section;
respondents living on their own were only asked the latter questions pertaining to wealth because their
income and business holdings information was gathered in their 2011 core PSID interview.


_**Section G: Education and Career Goals**_


A key marker of the transition into adulthood is attainment of post-secondary educational degrees,
which, in turn, feeds into work plans and career aspirations. Some young adults, however, may choose
an alternative route to a traditional college track, such as a military career (see Section E) or
vocational training.


In Section G, we gathered information about the amount and dates of education, starting with high
school completion or GED attainment, high school GPA, and experience with college entrance exams.
We asked if the respondent had ever attended or is currently attending college. For those who have
had some college experience, we asked the following questions:


Starting at G19 and G20, we gathered details about vocational education or any other training that
results in skills and certification for jobs. We asked if the respondent ever received vocational
education (in our definition, this includes on-the-job training) and if the respondent is currently
enrolled. For those currently receiving vocational education, we asked about the amount of time spent
per week in training, type of training—whether through a vocational or business school, vocational
rehabilitation, or on-the-job training—and why the respondent enrolled in the training. Reasons for
enrollment were coded on the spot into four basic categories: for job advancement or promotion, as a
job requirement, for licensing or certification, or to help with obtaining future job.


8


In this section, as well as in the military sequence in Section E, we asked how education, vocational
training, military training, and current work experiences fit into overall career plans. We asked a
series of four items in each of the scenarios just mentioned that focused on:


(a) Satisfaction with current schooling/training/work;


(b) Whether the schooling/training/work was part of a long-term career plan;


(c) If the respondent thinks that the schooling/training/work will help in getting
a/another job; and


(d) If the respondent thinks that schooling/training/work will help in succeeding in
a/another job.


Toward the end of Section G, beginning at G30, we turned to a focus on future expectations in these
areas as well as work. We assessed expectations for getting stable, well-paying jobs in the future and
if life for them will be more difficult than it was for their parents when their parents were their age.
We asked respondents to identify the job they would like at age 30—what type of work it involves, why
they aspire to that job, how successful they feel they will be at this job, and the likelihood of actually
attaining it.


At G40 and G41, the respondent described his or her strengths and weaknesses in a number of job skills
and characteristics of desirable jobs.


The path through Section G was fairly straightforward: respondents living at home and those away at
college were asked all questions in this section; however, those respondents living on their own were
not asked questions pertaining to their secondary education or graduation from high school, such as
“when did you receive your GED” or “what was the last grade you attended” because these items were
already collected in the core PSID interview.


_**Section H: Health**_


This section began with a self-rated measure of the individual’s overall health and asked if he or she
had, or had ever been diagnosed with, a series of chronic illnesses/conditions such as asthma,
diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and any mental health condition. For each condition, we asked age
when first diagnosed and limitations on normal daily activities that resulted from the condition. We
then asked a short series of questions about psychological distress both in the past 30 days and past 12
months. These questions are parallel to those asked in the core PSID instrument.


In young adulthood, individuals begin to take on more responsibility for maintaining their own health.
This task involves both routine visits to the doctor and dentist, maintenance of a healthy body weight,
and engagement in a number of lifestyle practices such as exercising, eating balanced meals, and
abstinence from smoking, binge drinking, and use of illegal drugs or misuse of prescription medicines.
In Section H, we asked about all of these activities.


The path through Section H was more complicated than for other sections. Some, but not all, of the
questions in the TA interview are the same as those in the core PSID. For respondents living on their
own as PSID heads or wives, we skipped the first part of the section and started with health behaviors
to avoid repeating questions that are collected in the core PSID interview.


9


_**Section K: Social Environment**_


Section K included five distinct series of questions addressing everyday discrimination, peer influence,
assault, risky behavior, and encounters with the law.


Day-to-day encounters with discrimination were measured by asking about frequency of experiencing
specific types of discrimination. If one or more situations were endorsed, we asked the perceived
reason for the discriminatory experience.


Peer influence was assessed through a set of questions about characteristics of friends with respect to
school and work-related activities, family and interpersonal relationships, community involvement, and
general outlook or attitudes about the future.


We asked about prior assaults, and the age at which an assault happened.


The items concerning dangerous and risky behaviors included fighting, damaging property, drunk
driving, and unprotected sex. We asked how often the respondent engaged in each behavior in the
prior six months. Incidents of arrest, probation, and jail time were measured separately through
questions on when and why the offense(s) occurred.


Respondents living at home, away at college, and living on their own all received the same set of
questions in this section.


_**Section L: Religiosity/Race & Ethnicity**_


In this brief section, we asked about current religious preferences and the importance of religion and
spirituality in the respondent’s life. The last two questions are asked of respondents living at home
with their parents (those living on their own received these two questions in their 2011 core PSID
interview). Standard race and ethnicity items from the Census are asked.


_**Section M: Outlook on Life**_


The TA interview ended with a short series of questions tapping into subjective well-being.

Respondents were asked 14 questions which comprehensively assessed adult well-being in terms of
emotional, psychological, and social well-being.

## **–** **Chapter 3  The TA Sample**

The TA-2011 sample is defined by four basic components:


1. Age 18-28 years;
2. No longer attending high school;
3. Participation in a CDS interview (1997, 2002/2003, or 2007); and
4. Family participation in the 2011 core PSID interview (either through their own
interview as Head or Wife/“Wife” or by identification as an “other family unit
member” in a household interview).


_**Age and High School Attendance**_


The transition into adulthood developmental period is defined for this study as spanning the ages 18 to
28. All potentially-eligible TA respondents were identified and screened in the core PSID interview.
During the TA interview, respondents were asked to confirm their date of birth, whether they were
attending school (and, if yes to attending school, what grade they were attending). If, during the TA
interview, the interviewer learned that the respondent was under the age of 18 or that the respondent
was still in high school, the interviewer was instructed to code-out the case as non-sample (age or
grade ineligible).


_**Member in the CDS Cohort**_


All TA sample members had a completed family-level baseline interview in CDS. This means that each
TA sample member had information from the primary caregiver interview about the TA individual when
they were a child. The TA sample members may have also participated in an educational assessment
and a child interview, but this was not required to consider the family-level information as being
complete.


_**Response in PSID 2011**_


Individuals were included in the TA-2011 sample if they completed a 2011 core PSID 2011 interview.


Based on the sample definition, a total of 2,219 individuals were identified for the TA-2011 survey.


The TA-2011 sample of 2,219 cases was released to the field for interviewing in four replicates, which
are described in Table 1. During data collection, 136 cases were determined to be ineligible, bringing
the total eligible to 2083, and 1,907 were completed as interviews. This yielded a 92% response rate
for the TA-2011 fieldwork effort. [1] Table 2 provides the final disposition for the total sample of 2,219
cases, whether released for fieldwork or not.

## **–** **Chapter 4  The TA-2011 Sample Weight**

To account for differential probabilities of selection due to the original PSID sample design and
subsequent attrition, the TA-2011 data are provided with a sample weight. The construction of the TA2011 sample weight is described in this chapter.


_**Sample Transition from CDS-I to TA-2011**_


The TA-2011 respondents were all originally selected for CDS-I in 1997 when they were 8–12 years of
age. In 1997, of the 3,563 children who participated in the original CDS-I interview, 2,358 would have
been projected to be eligible for participation in TA-2011. For these 2,358 cases, Table 3 summarizes
their disposition in TA-2011.


Among the projected eligible sample, which excludes deceased (n=6) and non-sample individuals
(n=23), a total of 1,907 interviews were completed, resulting in a cumulative unweighted response rate
of 81.9% (i.e., 1,907 / (1,907+422) = 0.819). [2] See Chapter 5 for a description of the TA-2011 wavespecific response rate (92%) and data collection procedures and outcomes.

|<br>|~~No longer eligible~~<br>|

|~~29~~|~~Subtotal~~|



_**Methodological Approach**_


Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal
probabilities of sample selection and non-response or data that is missing at random (MAR; Little and


2 The cumulative response rate is defined as a ratio of the number of cases that were successfully
interviewed in TA-2011 to the number of cases that were projected to be eligible for TA-2011 in 1997,
excluding deceased and non-sample individuals.


13


Rubin, 2002). [3] These weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each observation is
selected and, conditional on selection, that individuals respond to the survey questions. With
longitudinal data, this joint probability at time _t_, where the study has started at _t_ -1 or earlier, can be
expressed as the following


_P(S_ _t_ _=1)=P(S_ _t-1_ _=1)*P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1),_ _(1)_


where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in the study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at time
_t._ The probability of being a participant at time _t_ is a product of the probability of participating in the
previous period and the conditional “probability” of being response in the current period. Because the
first term on the right-hand side of Equation _(1)_ is proportional to the reciprocal of the weight in the
previous period, the weight in the current period is a product of the weight in previous period and the
inverse of the probability of response (the second term on the right hand side of Equation _(1)_ ). We will
refer to _1/ P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1)_ as the attrition adjustment factor.


_**TA-2011 Individual Weight**_


The TA-2011 individual weight was designed to account for the differential attrition between CDS-I (in
1997) and TA-2011, i.e. _t=_ 2011 and _t_ -1 _=_ 1997. Thus, the TA-2011 weight is a product of the CDS-I
weight, i.e., the individual-level primary caregiver/child weight (i.e., the weight variable named
‘CH97PRWT’), and the attrition adjustment factor. [4]


To obtain the attrition adjustment factor, the probability that a sample person was non-response in TA2011 was estimated using a logistic regression model with observations from the response and nonresponse strata (see Table 3). The obtained estimates are reported in Table 2. The results indicate
that attrition was higher among males, those in the South, older children, and those whose head of
household had a high school education. The resulting attrition adjustment factor is an inverse of the
predicted probability of successful re-interview, which is 1 minus the estimated probability of non
response.

Sample = 2329 observations.


As the final step in weight development, the newly constructed TA-2011 weight was censored or
trimmed to reduce the influence of extreme weight values on the variances of sample estimates of
population statistics. The cases with the weight values in the top one percent and in the bottom one
percent of the weight distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th] and 1 [st] percentiles of
the weight distribution, respectively. Table 5 reports key summary statistics for the final TA-2011
individual weight.

|Table 5: Summary Statistics for the TA-2011 Sample Weights|Col2|
|---|---|
|~~**Description**~~<br>|~~**Value**~~<br>|
|~~N~~<br>|~~1,907~~<br>|
|~~Minimum~~<br>|~~1.00~~<br>|
|~~Maximum~~<br>|~~68.05~~<br>|
|~~Mean~~<br>|~~17.33~~<br>|
|~~Standard Deviation~~<br>|~~14.73~~|


To examine the properties of the TA-2011 weight, we compared weighted estimates for selected
demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in CDS-I data—based on the CDS-I sub-sample,
that satisfy the eligibility requirements for TA-2011 and weighted with the CDS I weight—to the

estimates derived for the same variables measured in 1997—but based on the smaller TA-2011

interview sample and weighted with the TA-2011 weight. The results are provided in Table 6, and
show that the distributions of the selected characteristics are similar in the TA-2011 eligible subsample of CDS-I and in the TA-2011 interview sample, suggesting that the attrition adjustment for the
TA-2011 weight compensates for potential attrition bias for variables included in the analysis. It is
important to note, however, that this comparison does not necessarily rule out the possibility of
selection bias associated with other characteristics of the respondents.


The final TA-2011 weight is stored in the variable TA111143.

## – Chapter 5  Data Collection Procedures

This chapter provides an overview of the data collection procedures for TA-2011.


_**Contacting Respondents**_


The selected respondent was preloaded into a computer-based sample management system. Prenotification letters announcing the study and a respondent booklet were sent to all eligible sample
members. The respondent booklets were not always used—for example, the respondent booklet was
not used if it was unavailable (either had not arrived or was misplaced).


Busy schedules, caller ID, cell phones, and gatekeepers were the main obstacles in reaching and
scheduling interviews with these young adults. If the Respondent expressed concern about their cell
phone minutes used, interviewers offered an additional $10 incentive to offset the cost of extra
minutes used to complete the interview by cell phone. Interviewers enlisted contact persons (usually
parents) to help determine the best time to reach respondents. In some instances, parents contacted
respondents to let them know to expect a call from the study.


_**Quality Control**_


The Quality Control Plan for TA-2011 consisted of three components: certification, verification, and
evaluation. Certification, in the form of a practice interview, was completed immediately following
the Interviewer training and ensured that all field staff received appropriate training on the TA-2011
interview instrument and were able to complete the interview professionally and according to the
study protocol. Verification of interview data was conducted via telephone calls to respondents who
were re-asked questions that were included in the original interview so that the responses could be
compared. And evaluation of the interviewers’ adherence to general interviewing techniques and
study-specific protocols was based on the review of taped interviews by data collection staff.


_**Respondent Payments**_


All respondent payments were handled by project staff using an internal system. Participants were
either paid by check or money order. Each respondent received $50 for the completion of an interview
and could also be paid and additional $10 as a reimbursement if their interview was done via cell
phone. If a contact person was used to help find a participant they were offered between $10 and $20.

## **–** **Chapter 7  PSID Data Resource**

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative
sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning almost four decades of data collection,
contains over 50,000 variables on a diverse set of topics, including the dynamics of family composition
change, marital and birth histories, housing, income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of
family members, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 70,000 individuals have ever
participated in the panel, which includes up to four generations within a family. PSID is the longest
running panel on family and individual (including child) dynamics and has consistently achieved waveto-wave reinterview response rates of 96-98 percent. More information about the study and its

instruments can be obtained from its website:


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx


The PSID bibliography provides references to studies using the data for many research topics (key word
index provided):


http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/Search.aspx


For TA data users, the rich family data in the core PSID provide a valuable opportunity to explore the
effects of family environmental factors in analyses of child outcomes. In this chapter, our goal is to
provide users with some basic (although not comprehensive) information about the PSID sample,
interview content, public and sensitive data contract files, and data structure. We will start first with
an overview of the sample origins and design.


_**The PSID Sample**_


The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from two independent samples: a nationally representative
sample of roughly 3,000 households designed by the Survey Research Center at the University of
Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and an over-sample of roughly 2,000 low-income families from the Survey
of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO sample”). From 1968 to 1996, the PSID interviewed and reinterviewed individuals from families in these two samples every year, whether or not they were living
in the same dwelling or with the same people. Since 1997, interviewing has taken place every other
year. Also in 1997, PSID added an immigrant refresher sample that was designed to incorporate into
the PSID a representative sample of immigrants who had moved to the U.S. since 1968.


PSID follows adults through the full life course. Children born to an original-sample member are
classified as sample members and are eligible for tracking as separate family units when they set up
their own economically-independent households. Adult sample members who move out of the PSID
family units are tracked to their new family units. This procedure replicates the population’s familybuilding activity and produces a dynamic sample of families each year. The unique self-propagating
design implies that for many PSID families, the data archive includes self-reported information on three
(and occasionally now, four) generations within the same family at various points in their life course.
Through multiple waves collected over long time periods on a national population, the PSID is the only
data set ever collected on life course and multigenerational economic conditions, well-being, and
health in a long-term panel representative of the full U.S. population. Additional information about
sample members and follow status can be found here:

_**PSID Content**_

PSID contains a large number of variables that have been measured wave after wave using similar or
identical questions. Table 7 provides an overview of the content areas of PSID. The table indicates
the years for which variables were collected if they were not obtained in all waves. This table is not
an exhaustive description of the PSID content. Please see
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/default.aspx](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/default.aspx) for more details on PSID measures.

PSID variables can be categorized as family-level and individual-level. Most of the information from
any year’s data collection is categorized as **family-level variables** . The family-level variables include
not only information that applies to the family unit as a whole, but also almost all information about
the head and wife or “wife”. **Individual-level variables** are wave-specific data as well as timeinvariant information that may span multiple years. These variables cover basic demographic and
economic data about an individual in the study. If the individual was head or wife / “wife”, much of
the information in these variables is available among the family level variables, often in substantially
greater detail.


_**The Building Blocks to Using PSID Data on Families & Individuals**_

Because of the complexity of the PSID data structure, and its long-panel nature, there are a few PSID
concepts that are important to understand to effectively take advantage of the richness of the data
archive. This section provides some background on these concepts.

We begin by providing the PSID definition of “family”. The **Family Unit (FU)** is defined as a group of
people living together as a family. “As a family” means that the individuals are generally related by
blood, marriage, or adoption—although unrelated persons can be part of an FU if they are permanently
living together and share both income and expenses. The **Household Unit (HU)**, on the other hand, is
defined as the physical dwelling, such as a house or apartment, where members of the PSID FU reside.
Not everyone living in a HU is automatically part of the FU. The PSID survey is about FU Members only.

Families change from year to year. Each family unit in a specific data collection wave is assigned a
unique **Family ID**, sometimes called “ **Interview Number** ”. The most critical Family ID is the one
assigned in 1968 to families in the original sample. According to our following rules, we follow “splitoffs” that occur when children and others set up their own independent households. Thus, one family
in 1968 could have become 3-4 or more families by 2011. All of these families will have the same 1968
ID, because they originated from the same family in 1968, but will have different family IDs in 2011
because they are separate family units in 2011.

For each family, the Family ID number will change from year to year. For example, a 1968 family ID of
1234 will not be 1234 in 1969 or any other year. Yearly IDs are assigned based on receipt-order of the
interview—the first interview received from field is numbered 1, the second, 2, and so on. In the table
below, the “Smith Family” in 1968 had a Family ID of “0100” and included five FU members: Jason and
Andrea, and their three children Julie, Anne, and Todd:

|The “Smiths” in 1968|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Family Unit Member|Age|1968 Family ID|
|Dad (Jason)|36|0100|
|Mom (Andrea)|35|0100|
|Julie|12|0100|
|Anne|10|0100|
|Todd|8|0100|



By 2007, Jason and Andrea’s children had moved out on their own, thus creating four families out of
this original 1968 “Smith Family”. Notice each family keep their original 1968 ID, but also was assigned


27


unique 2007 Family ID:

|The “Smiths” in 2007|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Families|68 ID|2007 Family ID<br>“Interview Number”|
|Jason (Dad) & Andrea (Mom)|0100|0834|
|Julie, her husband and son|0100|1004|
|Anne<br>|0100<br>|0971<br>|
|~~Todd, his wife and daughter~~|~~0100~~|~~2202~~|



The PSID collects information about the **individuals** in each FU. In the PSID Data Center, each
individual is uniquely identified by their combined **1968 ID** (labeled as ER30001 in the Data Center) and
**Person Number** (labeled as ER30002). At the time of data release for each wave of the PSID, updates
to Person Numbers are made. This is important to remember because it will require data files that
were downloaded previously to be updated.

The most information is collected about the Head of the household, the second most about the wife (or
“wife” in the scenario of a cohabiter for one year or more), and the least amount of detail is collected
about other family unit members (OFUMs), who are oftentimes the children in the FU, but can also be
boy/girlfriends, grandparents, etc. All of the individuals in an FU have a **Relationship to the Head**

coded in the data files.

Within each wave of data, each FU has only one current Head. The person designated as Head may
change over time as a result of other changes affecting the family. When a new Head must be chosen,
the following rules apply:

The Head of the FU must be at least 16 years old and the person with the most financial responsibility
for the FU. If this person is female and she has a husband in the FU, then he is designated as Head. If
she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least one year, then he is Head. However, if
the husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the functions of Head, then the FU will

have a female Head.

A new Head is selected in situations such as:

- Last year’s Head moved out of the HU, died, or became incapacitated; or

- A female Head has gotten married; or

- An individual or group of individuals split-off to form a new FU.

The **Wife** is the spouse of the head; **“Wife”** is the cohabiter of one year or more. Much of the
information collected in the PSID about Heads is also collected about the Wives and “Wives”.

Continuing with our Smith Family example, Julie was one of the original sample members in 1968. She
is the daughter of Jason, who was then the Head. In 2007, she was living in her own FU, Family ID
1004, with her husband and their child. Her relationship to Head is now Wife. Her husband is Head

and their son is Child of Head.

**Julie’s Family in 2007**

|2007 Family ID|68 ID|Individuals|Relationship to Head|
|---|---|---|---|
|~~1004~~|~~0100~~|Julie (original 1968<br>sample member)|~~20 (Wife to Head)~~|
|1004|0100|Husband|10 (Head)|
|1004|0100|Son|30 (Child of Head)|



**Other Family Unit Members (OFUMs)** are the other individuals living in the family unit. Not as much
information is collected about OFUMs as Heads and Wives. Generally, the PSID main interview provides
individual-level data on the OFUMs as well as data each wave about their:

- Demographic information, such as birth month and year, sex, date of death, family unit status,
wave-specific response status;


- Marital and fertility histories and cohabitation status;


- Work status, number of jobs, occupation, weeks worked on job, during which months of
previous year, hours per week;


- Other income sources (income from dividends and interest, TANF, SSI, welfare, Social Security,
unemployment compensation, worker’s compensation, child support, help from relatives);


- (For OFUMs 16 years and older) highest grade or year of school completed;


- (For OFUMs 16-49 years of age) date last attended school and whether currently enrolled as part
time or full time student; and


- Health insurance coverage.


Note that CDS “children” and certain TA respondents are OFUMs in the PSID data collections and are
considered PSID individuals. Data about them in the main PSID interviews can be merged onto CDS and

TA data files.

In CDS, the **primary and secondary caregivers were based on the relationship to the child** (variables
“RELPCG07” and RELOCG07” in 2007). To merge data from PSID about the caregivers into the CDS or
TA, it is helpful to know the caregivers’ relationships to Head. In some situations, the relevant data
may have only been collected for Heads and Wives. Fortunately, this is the case for the majority of
the PCG and OCGs.

Keeping in mind the PCG’s relationship to Head, to construct, for example, the PCG average work
hours, it is useful to know that PSID asks for this information and stores it in three separate variables
depending on the individual’s relationship to head:


ER36170 BC43 On average, how many hours a week did you work on this job in 2006?-CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (HEAD)


ER36428 DE43 On average, how many hours a week did she work on this job in 2006?-CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (WIFE)

At each wave, the PSID sample comprises of “re-interview” families and split-off families. A
**reinterivew family** is a family unit (FU) that was interviewed in the prior wave. In the case of children
leaving home, the main family is almost always the parental family. A **split-off family**, on the other
hand, consists of a person or group of people (at least one of whom is a “followable” person of any
age) who moved out from a main family since the prior wave’s interview to form a new, economically
independent family unit. Several criteria must be met for a split-off to occur. In addition to having
moved out since the prior wave and to being “followable” (i.e., having an original 1968 family
identification), the person or group of people have not moved to an institution such as college or prison
or to another family unit within the panel study. Moreover, the person or group of people who have
moved out and formed their own family unit must be economically independent (i.e., they must be
paying their own living expenses) from the family unit from which they split off. Information that
informs the criteria is gathered at the main family interview, during the household listing stage. The
main family respondent provides these details. Note that these are general rules and that sometimes
unique situations arise that determine whether a person or group of persons becomes a split-off. For
example, while moving to an institution, such as college, does not generally meet the criteria for
becoming a split-off, if the person is working, paying their own living expenses, and paying their own
educational expenses in addition to attending school, then this person would be considered a split-off.
Information that can inform this type of scenario is gathered in Section G of the family interview and in
the interviewer observations. The living situation and interview data for each and every possible splitoff case are first reviewed before split-off status is granted.


_**Family Composition Change**_

When looking at variables pertaining to the same person(s) over time, the variable called “Sequence
Number” can be of help in understanding continuity and change in family composition from wave to
wave. The **Sequence Number**, found in the individual file, identifies an individual’s status within a
family unit at each wave of data collection. The sequence number has the following coding scheme:


1-20 Individuals who were in the family at the time of the current wave interview


51-59 Individuals who were in institutions at the time of the current wave interview


71-80 Individuals who moved out of the FU or out of institutions and established their own households

between the prior and current wave interview


81-89 Individuals who died by the current interview but were living at the time of the prior wave

interview.

PSID also has a variable (“ **Whether Moved In/Out** ”) to indicate whether the individual moved in or out
of a family unit in a given wave. The 2011 codebook definition below provides the coding for this

variable:


30


|1|Moved in or born between the 2009 and 2011 interviews; split-off in 2011|
|---|---|
|2|~~Appeared; moved in by the time the 2009 interview was taken but not included in FU for~~<br>2009 (i.e. listing error)<br>|
|5|~~Moved out of FU or out of an institution between the 2009 and 2011 interviews and was~~<br>not included in a 2011 panel FU|
|6|Moved out of FU and into an institution between the 2009 and 2011 interviews|
|7|Living in 2009 but died by the time of the 2011 interview<br>|
|8 <br>|~~Disappeared; moved out prior to the 2009 interview, but included in FU for 2009 (usually~~<br>a listing error)|


_**PSID Data Center Files**_

Most of the family and individual-level data on all waves of the PSID, CDS, and TA are housed in the
Online PSID Data Center. There are tutorials that provide a guided overview to using the data.
Customized data sets and codebooks can be generated through the easy-to-use Online Data Center.


_**Data Files – Individual, Family, CDS, and TA**_

In the Online PSID Data Center, the data are grouped by PSID main study data and by CDS and TA data.
Within the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family level files. The
individual level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data, mentioned earlier in this
chapter. The family-level files include not only “raw” interview data but also complex generated
variables on income, work, wealth, sample weights, and other measures. Data, by wave of the study,
are provided as the next level within each of the data groupings. In the CDS and TA data group, the
data are clustered by child-level files, which include all of the interview modules, and by time diary
activity files, which are at the activity level.
