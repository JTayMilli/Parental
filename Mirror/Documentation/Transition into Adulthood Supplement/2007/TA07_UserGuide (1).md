## **Chapter 1 – An Introduction to the TA study**

_**Bridging a Gap**_


The “CDS Youth’s Transition into Adulthood” (TA) study is part of the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) and its Child Development Supplement (CDS). The TA study was initiated to
bridge a gap between the data collected in the PSID, primarily on adults who have started their
own families, and the data collected in the CDS supplement on co-resident children up to age

18.


Although the PSID collects some information about all co-resident members of PSID families,
the greatest detail is collected on the head and wife (or “wife,” a female cohabiter of at least
a year). Data include education, income, employment, health, fertility, household
expenditures, and more. The CDS collects information on the children of PSID families up to
age 18, looking at health, well-being, cognition, relationships, and early human capital
formation. Without the Transition to Adulthood study, this configuration would result in a large
gap in information about offspring between their last CDS interview in adolescence and their
first interview as a PSID head or wife, a loss of significant information about early adult

transitions.


Unlike 42 years ago when the PSID first started, many transitions into adulthood are made
while the young adults are still dependent on their parents. In the past several decades in
particular, the U.S. and other countries have seen a pronounced prolongation of young
adulthood, with youth no longer moving quickly from secondary education into the labor force
and independent economic living. For today’s young adults, the years from age 18 to 24 are
critical for life span development. It is during this period that they make major investments in
education, and plan and initiate their careers. For the PSID, this means that important
educational and occupational transitions are often made while young adults are too old to be
included in the CDS, and many years before they become eligible to be interviewed as PSID
family heads and wives.


In fact, based on data from the PSID, less than half of young adults will become heads or wives
of their own PSID family before they reach 24 years of age.


The launching of the TA study was motivated by recognition that these years of young
adulthood are marked by choices, changes, and transitions that have profound life-long
consequences. The TA study was first conducted in 2005, was collected again in 2007, and will
be collected biennially in parallel to the PSID data collection until at least 2011.


The TA study was designed to build on the information collected from children when they were
interviewed as adolescents in the CDS-II, and to ensure the data complement the information
that will be collected when these 18 to 24 year olds are interviewed in future waves of the
core PSID. Therefore, understanding the Transition into Adulthood study requires, familiarity
with the design and content of the core PSID and CDS data collection projects, brief
descriptions of which are provided below.


TA 07 User Guide Page 4


_**Overview of PSID and CDS**_


The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally
representative sample of U.S. families. Since 1968, the PSID has collected data on family
composition changes, housing and food expenditures, marriage and fertility histories,
employment, income, wealth, time spent in housework, health, expenditures, philanthropy,
and more. Over 60,000 people have ever participated in the panel, which includes up to four
generations within a family. The PSID is the longest running panel on family dynamics and is
considered one of the most important data archives in the world.


The PSID follows adults through the full life course. Children born to an original-sample
member are classified as sample members and are eligible for tracking as separate family units
when they set up their own households.


The PSID now is conducted every other year by telephone, with data collection commencing in
March and ending by December of odd years.


In 1997, PSID initiated the Child Development Supplement (CDS) to collect additional data on
children, age 0-12, and their parents. The objective of this supplement was to allow
researchers to study the dynamic process of early human capital formation. The CDS-I collected
data on 2,394 PSID families and their 3,563 children. In 2002-2003, CDS-II re-contacted these
families, and successfully re-interviewed 2,017 of them (91%), which provided data on 2,908
children/adolescents aged 5-18 years. The data collection activities for CDS-I, II, and III were
quite extensive. Within the context of family, neighborhood, and school environments, CDS
gathered information about a broad array of developmental outcomes including (but not
limited to) physical health, emotional well-being, cognitive abilities and academic
achievements, and social relationships with family and peers. Each CDS target child could have
up to eight modules of data collected from three different family members (primary and
secondary caregivers and target child) and a school resource (teacher and/or school
administrative data).


Because the CDS is a supplement to the PSID, the study takes advantage of an extensive
amount of family demographic and economic data about the CDS target child’s family,
providing more extensive family data than any other nationally-representative longitudinal
survey of children and youth in the U.S.


It is anticipated that many of these CDS youth will eventually become the future ‘active panel’
of the core PSID when they move from their parents’ home and establish households of their
own. Under the current design, data will be collected on these youth at up to three points in
time until age 18, then biennially from age 18 to 24 under the TA study, and then at around
age 25 or whenever independence is established, by the core PSID. This rich and broad set of
data will provide information on family background, early human capital development,
investments in education and careers in early adulthood, transitions into adult family

formation.

# **Chapter 2  An Overview of TA File Structures**

The TA questionnaire is separated into 12 sections, each of which refers to a specific section of
interview content. A summary of each section is provided below.


_**Section A: Time Use**_


In Section A, we measure the time respondents spent on a select number of leisure and social
activities. The items that ask about involvement in organized arts and sport, TV watching,
reading, and computer use are items repeated from the CDS, permitting time-series analysis of
activity patterns in these areas. In other sections we ask about time spent in additional
activities, as well as time spent with friends, family, and romantic partners. The questions in
this section ask about frequency of participation in the previous 12 months.


_**Section B: Responsibilities**_


In this brief section, we assess the level of responsibility that the respondent assumes for living
arrangements and money management, including earning their own living, paying rent or
mortgage, paying their bills, and managing their money. Respondents are asked to rate their
abilities to manage their money and solve day-to-day problems.


In addition, information about living arrangements during a typical school year and summer is
collected. For respondents who spent most of their time living at their parents’ home, we ask
about the expected timing of moving out. For those living at college or on their own we ask
questions about the likelihood of moving back in with their parents.


_**Section C: Self**_


Section C consists of self-rated levels of skill in areas such as leadership, intelligence,
independence, confidence, and problem solving, as well as self-rated psychosocial measures on
worries and discouragement.


_**Section D: Marriage, Family, and Relationships**_


This section measures the current marital and cohabitation status of the individual and

subjective evaluations of all romantic/intimate relationships, asking questions about living
arrangements,relationship satisfaction, time spent with partner, future expectations, and the
likelihood of marriage and/or divorce. Information is collected on past and present pregnancies
and fertility expectations, gender roles, child rearing and family values, and parenting skills
and experiences. Respondents are also asked about their relationship with their own parents
to provide repeated measures from the CDS.


Respondents living at home or away at college are asked all questions in this section;
respondents living on their own as PSID heads and/or wives are not asked questions about the
timing of any spousal death or divorce, or when they began living with their current partner, as
these are covered in their main PSID 2007 interview.


TA 07 User Guide Page 6


_**Section E: Employment**_


This section collects detailed information on current employment status and all types of
employment and money-earning activities for the previous two years. Data are collected on
salary/wages, work hours, experience, size and nature of the employer, service in any armed
forces branch, reasons for being unemployed and/or not working, and methods and frequencies
of job hunting. Self-rated satisfaction measures are also obtained.


A new question series was added in 2007 (E30C-E32) to capture information about the rate of
health insurance coverage among young adults.


Respondents living at home or away at college are asked all questions in this section; however,
those living on their own are asked only questions on participation in the armed services, as
other employment information is obtained in their main PSID 2007 interview.


_**Sections F and W: Income and Wealth**_


In Section F, we collect information on income earned in the previous year from nonemployment sources, including workers and unemployment compensation, dividends, interest,
trust funds, child support, welfare, and gifts. We also ask about financial help received from
parents and other relatives. A short series of questions measures estimated net worth in
automobiles, stocks and bonds, checking and savings accounts, life insurance policies, and any
other assets and investments. Information on student loans, credit card balances, and other

debts is also collected.


Respondents living with their parents or away at college are asked all questions in this section;
respondents living on their own are only asked the questions pertaining to wealth, as their
income and business holdings information is gathered in their main PSID 2007 interview.


_**Section G: Education and Career Goals**_


In Section G, we gather information about the amount and dates of education, starting with
high school completion or GED attainment, high school GPA, and experience with college
entrance exams. We ask if the respondent ever attended or is currently attending college. For
those who have had some college experience, we ask about vocational education, or any
training, including on-the-job, that results in skills and certification for employment. For those
currently involved in vocational education, we ask about the amount of time spent per week in
training, type of training, and reason for training in four categories: job advancement, job
requirement, licensing or certification, or future job.


In this section, as well as in the military sequence in Section E, we ask how education,
vocational training, military training, or current work experiences fit into the respondent’s
overall career plans, with four questions on respondent’s satisfaction with current
schooling/training/work, and views on the expected usefulness of the schooling/training/work
in fulfilling long-term career plans, obtaining employment or another job, or having greater job

success.


Toward the end of Section G, we focus on future expectations. We assess respondents’
expectations for getting stable, well-paying jobs in the future; we ask them if they think life
for them will be more difficult than it was for their parents at their age; and we ask them to


TA 07 User Guide Page 7


describe the job they would like to have at age 30, including what type of work it involves, why
they aspire to it, how successful they feel they will be at this job, and the likelihood of
actually attaining it.


Finally, the respondent is asked to describe his or her strengths and weaknesses in a number of
job skills and characteristics of desirable jobs.


Pathing for Section G is fairly straightforward: respondents living at home and those away at
college are asked all questions in this section; respondents living on their own are not asked
the questions pertaining to their secondary education or graduation from high school, since
these items are already queried in the main PSID interview.


_**Section H: Health**_


This section begins with a self-rated measure of the individual’s overall health and determines
if he or she has or has ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses/conditions such as
asthma, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, or mental health condition. For each condition, we
ask age first diagnosed and limitations on normal daily activities that result from the condition.
We then ask a short series of questions about psychological distress both in the past 30 days
and past 12 months. These questions are parallel to those asked in the main PSID instrument.


Section H also asks about routine visits to the doctor and dentist, body weight, and lifestyle
practices such as exercising, diet and nutrition, smoking, binge drinking, use of illegal drugs,
and misuse of prescription medicines.


This section includes 13 questions (H50-H53F) about sexual relationships and practices.


Respondents living on their own skip the first part of the section, since the questions are
collected in the main PSID interview, and start with health behaviors.


_**Section K: Social Environment**_


Section K includes five series of questions addressing everyday discrimination, peer influence,
assault, risky behavior, and encounters with the law.


Day-to-day encounters with discrimination are measured by asking about frequency of
experiencing various discriminatory situations. If a respondent indicates one or more, we ask
about the perceived reason for the discriminatory experience.


Peer influence is examined through a set of questions about characteristics of friends at school
and work, family and interpersonal relationships, community involvement, and general outlook

or attitudes about the future.


We ask about whether ever assaulted, and age at which the event happened.


The items concerning dangerous and risky behaviors include fighting, damaging property, drunk
driving, and unprotected sex. We ask how often the respondent engaged in each behavior in
the prior six months. Incidences of arrest, probation, and jail time are measured separately
through questions on when and why the offense(s) occurred.


TA 07 User Guide Page 8


All respondents, whether living at home, away at college, or on their own, get the same set of
questions in this section.


_**Section L: Religiosity/Race & Ethnicity**_


In this brief section, we ask about current religious preferences and the importance of religion
and spirituality. Standard race and ethnicity items from the Census are also asked. Two religion
questions in this section are not asked of respondents living on their own, as these are covered
in the PSID main study interview.


_**Section M: Outlook on Life**_


The TA interview ends with a short series of questions tapping into subjective evaluations
regarding one’s self and society.

# **Chapter 3  The TA 2007 Sample**

Eligibility criteria for participants in the TA 2007 sample are listed below and explained in more

detail thereafter:


1. they are at least 18 years old
2. they no longer attend high school
3. they participated in the CDS-I or CDS-II interview (1997 or 2002/2003)
4. their family participated in the PSID 2007 interview


_**Education and Age**_


For the TA study, the transition into the adulthood developmental period is defined as
commencing once high school education ends and the individual reaches age 18. Former CDS
participants turning 18 within calendar year 2007 were contacted for an initial screening to
determine if they were willing to complete a CDS or a TA interview. Those who agreed and
were still in high school became part of the CDS-III sample, and those who had graduated were
interviewed as part of the TA study.


_**Member in the CDS Cohort**_


All TA sample members had a completed family-level baseline interview at CDS-I in 1997. This
means that at least the primary caregiver of the TA sample member completed an interview
about that child. The TA sample members may have also participated in an educational
assessment and interview, but it was not required.


About 90% of the TA sample members also had a family-level interview completed in 2002/2003
for CDS-II. For these participants, we have at least a second primary caregiver interview, and
for about 80%, we have their participation in an assessment, interview, and/or a time diary as

well.


_**Response in PSID 2007**_


Individuals were included in the TA 2007 sample if their family provided a completed PSID
family interview in 2007. This approach differed from the strategy followed in the first wave
of the TA study in 2005, in which sample members were considered eligible for the TA 2005
sample even if their families were non-response in PSID 2005.


Based on the sample definition, a total of 1,312 individuals were identified for the TA 2007
survey. Due to the concurrent data collection period for PSID 2007 and TA 2007, 40 individuals
who were initially deemed ineligible because of nonresponse on the main PSID 2007 family
interview were found to be eligible after the interviewing period had ended.


The fielded sample size for the TA 2007 was 1,259, released in four replicates as shown in
Table 1 below. During data collection, 11 cases were determined to be ineligible (incarcerated
or deceased respondents), and 1,118 were ultimately completed as interviews, resulting in a


TA 07 User Guide Page 10


90% response rate for the field effort. [1] Following the editing process for the main PSID 2007, 3
additional TA 2007 interviews were invalidated, bringing the final count associated with data
released to 1,115. Table 2 provides the final disposition for the total sample of 1,312 cases,

whether released for field work or not.

# **Chapter 4  The TA 2007 Sample Weight**

To account for differential probabilities of selection due to the original PSID sample design and
subsequent attrition, the 2007 Transition to Adulthood (TA 2007) data are provided with a
sample weight. The construction of the TA 2007 sample weight is described in the document.


_**Sample Transition from CDS-I to TA 2007**_


The young adults interviewed for the TA 2007 study were originally part of the sample of PSID
families with young children (age 0-12 years) that were interviewed for the first wave of the
Child Development Supplement (CDS-I). Data collection for CDS-I was completed in 1997, when
most of the TA-2007 young adults were between 8 and 12 years old.


Of the 3,563 children who participated in the original CDS-I interview in 1997, 1,472 would
have been projected to be eligible for participation in TA 2007. [2] Table 3 provides the
disposition of these 1,472 cases in the TA 2007 sample. Of the projected eligible participants,
which excludes deceased (n=9) and non-sample individuals (n=24), 1,115 resulted in completed
interviews, resulting in a cumulative response rate of 77%. [3] See Chapter 5 for a description of
the TA 2007 wave-specific response rate (90%) and data collection procedures and outcomes.

[(http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/TA07-UserGuide.pdf).](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/TA07-UserGuide.pdf)
3 Here, cumulative response rate is defined as a ratio of the number of cases that were
successfully interviewed in 2007 to the number of cases that were projected to be eligible for
TA 2007 as of 1997, excluding deceased and non-sample individuals.


TA 07 User Guide Page 13


_**Methodological Approach**_


Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal
probabilities of sample selection and non-response or data that is missing at random (MAR;
Little and Rubin, 2002). [4] These weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each
observation is selected and, conditional on selection, that individuals respond to the survey
questions. With longitudinal data, this joint probability at time _t_, where the study has started
at _t-1_ or earlier, can be expressed as the following


_P(S_ _t_ _=1)=P(S_ _t-1_ _=1)*P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1)_ _(1)_


where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in a study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at
time _t._ The probability of being a participant at time _t_ is a product of the probability of
participating in the previous period and the conditional probability of response in the current
period. As the first term on the right hand side of _(1)_ is proportional to the reciprocal of the
weight in the previous period, the weight in the current period is a product of the weight in
previous period and the inverse of probability of response (the second term on the right hand
side of _(1)_ ). We will refer to _1/ P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1)_ as the attrition adjustment factor.


_**TA 2007 Individual Weight**_


The TA 2007 individual weight is designed to account for the differential attrition between
CDS-I (in 1997) and TA 2007, that is: _t=_ 2007 and _t-1=_ 1997. Thus, the TA 2007 weight is a
product of the CDS-I weight – the individual-level primary caregiver/child weight (i.e., the
weight variable named ‘CH97PRWT’) – and the attrition adjustment factor. [5]


To obtain the attrition adjustment factor, the probability that a sample person was nonresponse in the TA 2007 was estimated from the logistic regression model using observations
from the Response and Non-response strata (see Table 3. The obtained estimates are reported
in Table 4. The results indicate that attrition was higher among immigrants and those who
resided in non-metropolitan areas at the time of the CDS-I interview. The resulting attrition
adjustment factor is an inverse of the predicted probability of successful re-interview, which is
1 minus the estimated probability of non-response.

**Table 4. Logistic Regression Estimates of Non-response in TA 2007, Conditional on CDS-I**
**Characteristics**


- The initial 1968 PSID sample was drawn from two independent samples: a nationally representative
sample of about 3,000 households designed by the Survey Research Center (the “SRC sample”) and an
over-sample of about 2,000 low income families from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO
sample”).


TA 07 User Guide Page 15


As the final step in the weight development, the newly constructed TA 2007 weight was
censored to reduce the influence of extreme weight values on the variances of sample
estimates of population statistics. The cases with the weight values in the top percent and in
the bottom percent of the weight distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th]
and 1 [st] percentiles of the weight distribution, respectively. Table 5 reports key summary
statistics for the final TA 2007 individual weight.


**Table 5. Summary Statistics**

|TA 2007 Individual Weight|Col2|
|---|---|
|~~N~~<br>|~~1115~~<br>|
|~~MIN~~<br>|~~1.02~~<br>|
|~~MAX~~<br>|~~82.1~~<br>|
|~~MEAN~~<br>|~~18.5~~<br>|
|~~STD~~|~~16.2~~<br>|



To examine the properties of the TA 2007 weight, we compared weighted estimates for some
basic demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic variables in CDS-I data – based on the CDS-I
sub-sample that satisfies the eligibility requirements for TA 2007, and weighted with the CDS I
weight – to the estimates derived for the same variables measured in 1997, but based on the
smaller TA 2007 interview sample and weighted with the TA 2007 weight. The results provided

in Table 6 show that the distributions of the selected characteristics are similar in the TA 2007

eligible sub-sample of CDS-I and in TA 2007 interview sample, suggesting that the attrition
adjustment for the TA 2007 weight compensates for potential attrition bias for variables
included in the analysis. It is important to note, however, that this comparison does not
necessarily rule out the possibility of selection bias associated with other characteristics of the
respondents.


The final TA 2007 weight is stored in the variable TA070937.

# **Chapter 5  Data Collection Procedures**

This chapter provides an overview of the data collection protocols for the TA 2007 collection

year.


_**Contacting Respondents**_


A sample management system was used to collect information on selected eligible participants
for the TA 2007 study. Pre-notification letters announcing the study and a respondent booklet
was sent to all eligible sample members. The respondent booklets were not always used if the
respondent was reached to do an interview and the respondent booklet was not available
(either had not arrived, or was misplaced).


Busy schedules, caller ID, and cell phones were the main obstacles in reaching and scheduling
interviews with these young adults. To maximize our chances of making contact, we amended
our field procedures in several ways. We offered a cell phone reimbursement of $10 to offset
the cost of extra minutes used to complete the interview by cell phone. We authorized calls
beyond the end of the last call window (9:00 pm) to reach respondents who were not available
until later in the day, assigning a “night owl” interviewer in the Eastern Time zone to make
late calls to the Mountain and Pacific zones. Finally, interviewers enlisted contact persons
(usually parents) to help determine the best time to reach respondents. In some instances,
parents called respondents to let them know we were trying to reach them so they would
recognize and answer the call when viewed on Caller ID.


_**Quality Control**_


The Quality Control Plan for the TA data collection consisted of three components:
Certification, Verification, and Evaluation. Certification consisted of interviewer training
immediately followed by a practice interview. This ensured that all field staff received
appropriate training on the TA interview instrument and were able to complete the interview
professionally and according to the study protocol. Verification of interview data was
conducted by comparing answers obtained from respondents in follow-up telephone calls to
answers received in the original interview. Evaluation of the field interviewers’ adherence to
general interviewing techniques and study-specific protocols was conducted via review of
taped interviews by data collection staff.


_**Respondent Payments**_


All respondent payments were handled by project staff using an internal system. Participants
were either paid by check or money order. Each respondent received $40 for the completion of
an interview and could also be reimbursed an additional $10 if their interview was done via cell

phone.

# **Chapter 6  TA 2007 Interview Content**

As in TA 2005, the interview content for TA 2007 was sub-divided into sections. Sections A
(Time Use), E (Employment), and H and L (Health) were all updated for 2007. This chapter
highlights all new content.


_**Section A – Time Use**_


The variable A14OS was added to the group of time use questions as follows:


A14OS - Which types of organizations have you been involved with in your volunteer or
community service work in the last 12 months?


This allows for the respondent to add an answer if they do not find an appropriate response
among the choices provided for this type of activity.


_**Section E – Employment**_


Four new questions ask about the duration and type of unemployment. E7B and E8B ask
respondents how much of 2006 they spent unemployed, and how they split their time between
looking and not looking for work. E9B and E9G are the same questions, but in reference to
2005. Since the interview was conducted before the end of 2007, the information about 2007
and 2008 will be collected during the TA-09 interview.


A new line of questions (E30A-E30G) on employer-provided health care coverage was also
added in 2007, asking about the availability and types coverage, and the respondent’s
participation.


Also added in 2007 were work duration questions. Variables E40_1, E43_1, E58, and E60 ask
about the specifics of work schedules including average hours worked per week, and number of
weeks worked per year. These questions were asked of 2005 and 2006, the years passed since
the last TA collection during 2005.


_**Section H – Health**_


A more comprehensive assessment of sexual activity was collected in the TA 2007 interview
with the following questions, emanating from a positive answer to H50:


**H50 -** Have you ever had sexual intercourse?


**H51A -** In what year and month did you have sexual intercourse for the first time?


**H51B -** In what month did you have intercourse for the first time?


**H51C -** Have you had intercourse more than once?


**H51D -** About how many times have you had sexual intercourse in the past four weeks?


TA 07 User Guide Page 20


**H51E -** How many partners have you EVER had intercourse with? This includes any person
you had intercourse with, even if it was only once, or if you did not know him or her well.


**H52 -** Thinking of all the times you have had sexual intercourse, about how often have you
and your partner used a condom?


Relatedly, respondents who answer H50 in the affirmative are subsequently asked about birth
control pill use (for female respondents) as well as sexually transmitted diseases (testing and
diagnosis) in questions L53-L53F.


For full information on these new variables, please see the TA 2007 codebook.


_**Coding of Variables**_


The 2000 Census Occupation/Industry codes (3-digit) were applied to the occupation and
industry reported by TA respondents in all completed interviews. There was an average of 2.2
instances of jobs per respondent. Check coding was conducted on 10% of cases by a PSID staff
member. The application used for coding was developed and maintained by PSID staff.

# **Chapter 7 – PSID Data Resources**

As described in Chapter 1, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of
a nationally representative sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning more than
four decades of data collection, contains nearly 50,000 variables on a diverse set of topics,
including the dynamics of family composition change, marital and birth histories, housing,
income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of family members, expenditures,
philanthropy, and more. Over 60,000 people have ever participated in the panel, which
includes up to four generations within a family. The PSID is the longest running panel study on
family and individual (including child) dynamics and has consistently achieved wave-to-wave
re-interview response rates of 96-98%. More information about the study and its instruments
can be obtained from the PSID website: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/. The PSID
bibliography provides references to studies using the data for many research topics (key word
[index provided): http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/default.aspx .](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/default.aspx)


Users of TA data will find the rich source of family data from the main PSID provides an
incredible opportunity to explore family environmental factors in your analyses of child
outcomes. In this chapter, our goal is to provide TA data users with some basic information
about the PSID sample, interview content, public and sensitive data contract file, and data

structure.


_**The PSID Sample**_


The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from two independent samples: a nationally
representative sample of roughly 3,000 households designed by the Survey Research Center at
the University of Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and an over-sample of roughly 2,000 low income
families from the Survey of Economic Opportunity (the “SEO sample”). From 1968 to 1996, the
PSID interviewed and re-interviewed individuals from families in these two samples every year,
whether or not they were living in the same dwelling or with the same people. Since 1997,
interviewing has taken place every other year. Also in 1997, the PSID added an immigrant
refresher sample that was intended to bring the sample up to representativeness of
immigration into the U.S. since 1968.


The PSID follows adults through the full life course. Children born to an original-sample
member are classified as sample members and are eligible for tracking as separate family units
when they set up their own households. Adult sample members who move out of the PSID
family units are tracked to their new family units. This procedure replicates the population’s
family-building activity and produces a dynamic sample of families each year. New PSID
families form when children grow up and establish separate households. The unique selfreplacing design implies that for many PSID families, the data include self-reported information
on three, and sometimes four, generations within the same family at various points in their life

course.

The PSID has collected a unique data set covering economic conditions, family composition
changes, well-being, and health over multiple generations in a sample representative of the
full U.S. population. More information on what constitutes a ‘sample member’ and their ‘follow
[status’ can be found here: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/FAQ.aspx#95.](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/FAQ.aspx#95)


TA 07 User Guide Page 22


_**PSID Content**_


As touched on above, the PSID contains a large number of variables that have been measured
wave after wave in much the same, if not the identical, manner. Table 7 below gives a general
idea of the data collected but is by no means comprehensive. Years are provided when data
were collected for only some, but not all 36 waves of the PSID. Keep in mind that this table is
by no means exhaustive of the PSID content. Please see: http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu
documentation for more details on the PSID measures.

_**Family-Level and Individual-Level Variables in the PSID**_


PSID variables can be categorized as family-level and individual-level. Most of the data
collected are family-level variables, including not only information that applies to the family
unit as a whole, but also almost all information about the head and wife/“wife”. Individuallevel variables are wave-specific data as well as time-invariant information that may span
many years. These variables cover basic demographic and economic data about an individual in
the family unit (FU). If the individual was head or wife,much of the information in these
variables is available among the family level variables, often in substantially greater detail.


_**The Building Blocks to Using PSID Data on Families and Individuals**_


Because of the complexity of the PSID data structure and its long-panel nature, knowing a few
key PSID concepts will help users get the most from the rich data archive. This section of the
chapter attempts to give you some background on these concepts.

The PSID definition of Family Unit (FU) is a group of people living together as a family. “As a
family” means that the individuals are generally related by blood, marriage, or adoption,
although unrelated persons can be part of a FU if they are permanently living together and
share both income and expenses.

The Household Unit (HU) is defined as the physical boundary, such as a house or apartment,
where members of the PSID FU reside. Not everyone living in a HU is automatically part of the
FU. The PSID survey is about FU members only.

Families change from year to year. Each family unit in a specific data collection wave is
assigned a unique Family ID, sometimes called an Interview Number. The most critical Family
ID is the one assigned in 1968 to families in the original sample. According to our following
rules, we follow “split-offs” – children and other FU members – as they set up their own
households. One family in 1968 can become three, four, or more families by 2009. All of these
families will have the same 1968 ID, since they originated from the same family in 1968, but
will have different Family ID’s in 2009, since they are separate family units in 2009.

For each family, the Family ID number will most certainly vary from year to year. For example,
a 1968 Family ID of 1234 will not likely be 1234 in 1969 or any other year for that matter.
Yearly IDs are assigned based on receipt of the interview—the first interview in from field is
numbered 1, the second 2, and so on. In the example on the next page, the fictional Smith
Family in 1968 had a Family ID of 0100 and included five FU members: Jason and Andrea, and
their three children Julie, Anne, and Todd:


**The Smith Family in 1968 (fictional)**

|Family Unit Member|Age|1968 Family ID|
|---|---|---|
|Dad (Jason)|36|0100|
|Mom (Andrea)|35|0100|
|Julie|12|0100|
|Anne|10|0100|
|Todd|8|0100|



TA 07 User Guide Page 26


By 2007, Jason and Andrea’s children had moved out on their own, thus creating four families
out of this original 1968 Smith Family. Notice each family kept their original 1968 ID, but also
was assigned a unique 2007 Family ID/Interview Number:

|Families|1968 ID|2007 Family ID or<br>Interview Number|
|---|---|---|
|Jason (Dad) & Andrea (Mom)|0100|0834|
|Julie, her husband and son|0100|1004|
|Anne|0100|0971|
|Todd, his wife and daughter|0100|2202|



The PSID collects information about the individuals of each FU. In the online Data Center

(http://simba.isr.umich.edu/), each individual is uniquely identified by their combined 1968 ID
(labeled as ER30001 in the Data Center) and Person Number (labeled as ER30002). At the time
of data release for each wave of the PSID, updates to Person Numbers are made. This is
important to remember since it will require updating of data files downloaded at a previous
time.

The most information is collected about the Head of the household, the second most about the
wife (or “wife” in the scenario of a cohabiter for one year or more), and the least amount of
detail is collected about other family unit members (OFUMs), who are oftentimes the children
in the FU, but can also be boy/girlfriends, grandparents, etc. All of the individuals in an FU
have a coded Relationship to the Head in the data files.

Within each wave of data, each FU has only one current Head. The person designated as Head
may change over time as a result of other changes affecting the family. When a new Head must
be chosen, the following rules apply:


  - The Head of the FU must be at least 16 years old and the person with the most
financial responsibility for the FU.


  - If this person is female and she has a husband in the FU, then he is designated as Head.


  - If she has a boyfriend with whom she has been living for at least one year, then he is
Head.


  - If her husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the functions of Head,
then she is designated as Head.

A new Head is selected in situations such as:

  - Last year’s Head moved out of the HU (household unit), died, or became incapacitated


  - A female Head has gotten married


An individual or group of individuals split-off to form a new FU
Much of the information collected in the PSID about Heads is also collected about the Wives

and “Wives.”


TA 07 User Guide Page 27


Continuing with our fictional Smith Family example, Julie was one of the original sample
members in 1968. She was the daughter of Jason (Head) back then. In 2007, she was living in
her own FU, Family ID 1004, with her husband and their child. Her relationship to Head is now
Wife. Her husband is Head and their son is Child of Head.


**Julie’s Family in 2007 (fictional)**

|2007 Family ID|68 ID|Individuals|Relationship to Head|
|---|---|---|---|
|~~1004~~|~~0100~~|Julie (original 1968<br>sample member)|~~20 (Wife to Head)~~|
|1004|0100|Husband|10 (Head)|
|1004|0100|Son|30 (Child of Head)|



Generally, the PSID main interview provides some individual-level data on the Other Family
Unit Members (OFUMs), including data each wave about their:


  - Demographic information, such as birth month and year, sex, date of death, family
unit status, wave-specific response status


  - Marital and fertility histories, and cohabitation status


  - Work status, number of jobs, occupation, weeks worked on job, during which
months of previous year, hours per week


  - Other income sources (interest, TANF, SSI, welfare, social security, unemployment
compensation, worker’s compensation, child support, help from relatives)


  - For OFUMs 16 years and older, highest grade or year of school completed


  - For OFUMs 16-49 years of age, date last attended school and whether currently
enrolled as part-time or full-time student


  - Health insurance coverage


Note that CDS “children” are OFUMs in the PSID data collections and are considered PSID

individuals. Data about them in the main PSID interviews can be merged onto CDS data files.

In the CDS, the Primary and Secondary Caregivers (PCGs and OCGs) are defined in relationship
to the child (variables “RELPCG07” and RELOCG07” in 2007). If you are interested in merging
data from PSID about the Caregivers, it is helpful to know the Caregivers’ relationships to
Head. In some situations, the data you are interested in may have been collected only for
Heads and Wives. This accounts for the majority of the PCGs and OCGs.

If you are interested in constructing, for example, the PCG average work hours, you will find
that PSID asks for this information and stores it in three separate variables depending on the
PCG’s relationship to Head:


ER36170 BC43 On average, how many hours a week did you work on this job in
2006?--CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (HEAD)


ER36428 DE43. On average, how many hours a week did she work on this job in
2006?--CURRENT OR MOST RECENT MAIN JOB (WIFE)


TA 07 User Guide Page 28


At the beginning of this chapter, we described the PSID’s self-replacing sample design whereby
children or adult family members from PSID families who leave their family households are
subsequently interviewed once they have established their own economically independent
family unit. With this design, at any wave, the PSID has both main
(or re-interview) Family Units (FUs) – families that were interviewed in the prior wave – and
split-off FUs consisting of a person or group of people who left the main family household to
form a new family unit since the prior wave’s interview.

Several criteria must be met for a split-off to occur. The split-off person or group:


  - must have moved out since the prior wave,

  - must be ‘followable’ (i.e., have an original 1968 family identification),

  - must not have not moved to an institution such as college or prison or to another family
unit within the PSID,

  - must be economically independent (i.e., they must be paying their own living
expenses) from the family unit from which they split off.

Information used to decide whether the split-off criteria have been met is gathered in primarily
in Section G of the main family interview and in the interviewer observations. It should be
noted that the above are general rules and that sometimes unique situations arise that
determine whether a person or group of persons becomes a split-off. For example, while
moving to an institution, such as college, does not generally meet the criteria for becoming a
split-off, if the person is working, paying their own living expenses, and paying their own
educational expenses in addition to attending school, then this person would be considered a
split-off. The living situation and interview data for each and every possible split-off case are
reviewed before split-off status is granted.


_**Family Composition Change**_


The Sequence Number can be of help in understanding wave-to-wave change in family
composition., Found in the individual file, the Sequence Number identifies an individual’s
status with regard to the family unit at a given wave of data collection. It is coded as follows:


1-20 indicates that the individuals were in the family at the time of the current
wave interview.


51-59 indicates that the individuals were in institutions at the time of the current

wave interview.


71-80 indicates that the individuals moved out of the FU or out of institutions and

established their own households between the prior and current wave
interview.


81-89 indicates that the individuals died by the current interview but were living at
the time of the prior wave interview.


PSID also has a variable, Whether Moved In/Out, to indicate whether the individual moved in or
out of a family unit in a given wave of data. The 2007 codebook definition below helps
illustrate the detail of this variable.


1 Moved in or born between the 2005 and 2007 interviews; split-off in 2007


2 Appeared; moved in by the time the 2005 interview was taken but not included
in FU for 2005 (i.e., listing error)


TA 07 User Guide Page 29


5 Moved out of FU or out of an institution between the 2005 and 2007 interviews
and was not included in a 2007 panel FU


6 Moved out of FU and into an institution between the 2005 and 2007 interviews


7 Living in 2005 but died by the time of the 2007 interview


8 Disappeared; moved out prior to the 2005 interview, but included in FU for
2005 (usually a listing error)


_**PSID Data Center Files**_


Most of the family and individual-level data on all waves of the PSID and CDS are housed in the
online PSID Data Center. Tutorials provide a guided overview to using the data and
creatingcustomized data sets and codebooks. More information on using the Data Center is
provided in Chapter 14.


_**Data Groupings**_


In the Data Center, you will find the data grouped by PSID main study data and CDS data.
Within the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family-level
files. The individual-level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data, mentioned
earlier in this chapter. The family-level files include not only “raw” interview data but also
complex generated variables on income, work, wealth, sample weights, and other measures.
Data by study wave, are provided as the next level within each of the data groupings. In the
CDS data group, the data are clustered by child-level files, which include all of the interview
modules, and by time diary activity files, which are at the activity level.
