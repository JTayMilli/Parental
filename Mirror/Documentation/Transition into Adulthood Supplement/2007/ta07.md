**Coverscreen**
Q1. Hello, may I please speak with [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME]?
Hello, my name is IWER NAME and I am calling from the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan.
I am calling because we recently sent you an invitation to participate in a new study on young people in the United
States. This study is conducted by the same people who do the Family Economics Study and the Child
Development Supplement, both of which you and your family are participants.

Specifically, we would like to learn more about the experiences of young people as they move into adulthood,
what becoming an adult means today, and what influences young peoples’ decisions. There are questions about
schooling, job training, work, and family, but just as important are questions about your goals and expectations
dreams for the future.

this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced, even under a court order or subpoena, to release information that
could identify you. You should know, however, that researchers may provide information to appropriate
individuals or agencies if harm to you, harm to others, or child abuse becomes a concern. In addition, the agency

information if it audits us. They cannot report anything that will harm you, and they too are bound to protect your
privacy.

You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing
information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains
your written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold
that information.
