This scale is constructed using non-missing responses to the following questions:

TA171799 H83a. How Often Felt Nervous in Past Month

TA171800 H83b. How Often Felt Hopeless in Past Month

TA171801 H83c. How Often Felt Restless in Past Month

TA171803 H83e. How Often Felt Too Sad in Past Month

TA171804 H83f. How Often Felt Worthless in Past Month

The codes for these questions are as follows:

1 All of the time

2 Most of the time

3 Some of the time

4 A little of the time

5 None of the time

To create the scale, the items are rescored as follows:

A response of

'All of the Time' = 4 points,

'Most of the Time' = 3 points,

'Some of the Time' = 2 points,

'A Little of the Time' = 1 point, and

'None of the Time' = 0 points.

The scores are then summed; a score of 13 or higher indicates sensitivity around the

threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific

distress.

This variable may be based on fewer than the above six variables. Items containing "don't

know" and "refused" responses are not included in the calculation of the scale.

This scale was developed by Dr. Ronald Kessler, Professor of Healthcare Policy at Harvard

Medical School.

TA171978  "BODY MASS INDEX"                   NUM(4.1)

Body Mass Index

This variable was calculated as follows:

BMI =[(Weight in Pounds) / (Height in inches) x (Height in inches)] x 703

Height and weight values were taken from the following questions:

TA171787 H77. Weight--Total Pounds

TA171789 H78. Height--Feet Component

TA171790 H78. Height--Inches Component

Any extreme results, i.e., BMI of less than 15.0 or greater than 59.9, were recoded to 99,
since in such cases the accuracy of height and/or weight values is highly doubtful.

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to

both adult men and women. BMI categories are:

Normal weight = 18.5-24.9

Overweight = 25.0-29.9

Obese = BMI of 30.0 or greater

Beale-Ross Rural-Urban Continuum Code for Residence at the Time of the TA Interview

This variable is suppressed (filled with zeroes) in the public release file to protect the

anonymity of respondents. The data are available in a separate file to qualified users

under special contractual arrangements with the PSID; for more information, contact us at

PSIDhelp@umich.edu.

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes against the 2013

Rural-Urban Continuum Codes published by USDA downloaded from

https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/.aspx

The 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes

metropolitan counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan

counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area. The official Office of

Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three

metro and six nonmetro categories. Each county in the U.S. is assigned one of the 9 codes.

This scheme allows researchers to break county data into finer residential groups, beyond

metro and nonmetro, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that are

related to population density and metro influence. The Rural-Urban Continuum Codes were

originally developed in 1974. They have been updated each decennial since (1983, 1993,

2003, 2013), and slightly revised in 1988. Note that the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes

are not directly comparable with the codes prior to 2000 because of the new methodology

used in developing the 2000 metropolitan areas.
