TA150889 H14e. How Often Felt Too Sad in Past Month

The codes for these questions are as follows:
1 All of the time

2 Most of the time

3 Some of the time

4 A little of the time

5 None of the time

To create the scale, the items are rescored as follows:
A response of
'All of the Time' = 4 points,
'Most of the Time' = 3 points,
'Some of the Time' = 2 points,
'A Little of the Time' = 1 point, and
'None of the Time' = 0 points.

The scores are then summed; a score of 13 or higher indicates sensitivity around the
threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific
distress.

This variable may be based on fewer than the above six variables. Items containing "don't
know" and "refused" responses are not included in the calculation of the scale.

This scale was developed by Dr. Ronald Kessler, Professor of Healthcare Policy at Harvard

TA151283  "BODY MASS INDEX"                   NUM(4.1)
Body Mass Index

This variable was calculated as follows:

BMI =[(Weight in Pounds) / (Height in inches) x (Height in inches)] x 703

Height and weight values were taken from the following questions:

TA150934 H21. Weight--Total Pounds
TA150936 H22. Height--Feet Component
TA150937 H22. Height--Inches Component

Any extreme results, i.e., BMI of less than 15.0 or greater than 59.9, were recoded to 99,
since in such cases the accuracy of height and/or weight values is highly doubtful.

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to
both adult men and women. BMI categories are:

Normal weight = 18.5-24.9
Overweight = 25.0-29.9
Obese = BMI of 30.0 or greater

(TA151283), which is derived from an arithmetic calculation of body weight and height.
The use of BMI categories allows comparison of an individual's weight status to that of
the general population.

Beale-Ross Rural-Urban Continuum Code for Residence at the Time of the TA Interview

This variable is suppressed (filled with zeroes) in the public release file to protect the
anonymity of respondents. The data are available in a separate file to qualified users
under special contractual arrangements with the PSID; for more information, contact us at
PSIDhelp@umich.edu.

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes against the 2013
Rural-Urban Continuum Codes published by USDA downloaded from
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/.aspx

The 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes
metropolitan counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan
counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area. The official Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories have been subdivided into three
metro and six nonmetro categories. Each county in the U.S. is assigned one of the 9 codes.
This scheme allows researchers to break county data into finer residential groups, beyond
metro and nonmetro, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that are
related to population density and metro influence. The Rural-Urban Continuum Codes were
originally developed in 1974. They have been updated each decennial since (1983, 1993,
2003, 2013), and slightly revised in 1988. Note that the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes
are not directly comparable with the codes prior to 2000 because of the new methodology
used in developing the 2000 metropolitan areas.
