Transition into Adulthood 2005 [computerized data file].


## **Preface**

In 2005, the PSID began a new supplemental study called “Transition into Adulthood” (TA). This study
was designed to collect information from all children who had participated in the Child Development
Supplement (CDS) who had turned age 18, had completed or left high school and were members of
families still active in the PSID. The study collects data on young adult developmental pathways and
outcomes, filling a gap between the detailed information about development from early and middle
childhood through adolescence (as measured in CDS-I, CDS-II, and CDS-III), and the comprehensive
information on adulthood once these youths assume the role of economic independence and become
PSID heads and wives/”wives”. This Guide documents this first TA wave.

Staff
Frank P. Stafford is the Principal Investigator of the CDS-TA. Co-Principal Investigators are
Jacquelynne Eccles, Robert Schoeni, Wei-Jun Yeung, and Katherine McGonagle. Tina Mainieri led
project management activities for TA-2005. Eva Leissou of the University of Michigan Survey Research

**Section I: History and Background**
The Transition into Adulthood (TA) supplement
supports the continued collection of data on
families in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) who participated in the 1997 Child
Development Supplement (CDS) by adding new
content for youth in their transitions from
adolescence into young adulthood. To fully
understand the TA study, one must be familiar
with the core PSID and CDS data collection
projects. Therefore, a brief description of the
design and content of the PSID and the CDS is
provided. For additional information, please
see the PSID codebooks and the CDS user guides
located here:

http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/CDS/wavesd
oc.html

Panel Study of Income Dynamics: Begun in
1968, the PSID is a longitudinal study of a
representative sample of U.S. individuals and
the family units in which they reside. It
emphasizes the dynamic aspects of economic
and demographic behavior, but its content is
broad, including sociological, psychological,
and physical health measures. The PSID is the
longest running panel on family and individual
(including child) dynamics and has consistently
achieved unprecedented wave-to-wave
reinterview response rates of 96-98%.

The original 1968 PSID sample was drawn from
two independent samples: a nationally
representative sample of 2,930 households
designed by the Survey Research Center at the
University of Michigan (the “SRC sample”) and
an over-sample of 1,872 low income families
subset from the 1967 Survey of Economic
Opportunity (the “SEO/Census sample”). From
1968 to 1996, the PSID interviewed and reinterviewed individuals from families in these
two samples every year, whether or not they
were living in the same dwelling or with the
same people. Adults have been followed
through the full life course, and a
confidentiality-protected mortality data file
includes information on nearly 5,000 PSID
sample members who have died since 1968.
Children have been interviewed as their own
family unit after they have left their parents’
household. This unique self-replacing design
implies that for many PSID families, the data
include self-reported information on three (and



occasionally now, four) generations within the
same family at various points in their life
course. Through multiple waves collected over
long time periods on a national population, the
PSID is the only data set ever collected on life
course and multigenerational economic
conditions, well-being, and health in a longterm panel representative of the full U.S.
population. Comparisons of PSID data with
simple cross-sectional benchmark studies—the
March Current Population Survey for income
(Gouskova and Schoeni, 2002a), Survey of
Consumer Finances for wealth, National Health
Interview Survey for health status and health
behaviors (Gouskova and Schoeni, 2002b), and
the Consumer Expenditures Survey for
expenditures (Charles et al., 2004)—support the
claim that the sample, with weights, remains
representative of the U.S. population for a
given temporal snapshot.

Child Development Supplement: The CDS
examines multiple developmental outcomes in
the areas of psychological well-being, social
relationships with family and peers, cognitive
development, physical health, and education.
These developmental domains can be studied
within the context of family, neighborhood,
and school environments over time. The multilevel, multidisciplinary, and longitudinal nature
of the research design facilitates analysis of the
relationships between developmental measures
mentioned above and changes in family
structures and living arrangements,
neighborhood economic and social conditions,
and school resources and programs.

The CDS embarked on its first data collection in
the spring of 1997. Collecting data on as many
as two randomly selected children aged from
birth through 12 years in PSID families, the first
wave successfully completed interviews for
3,563 children in roughly 2,400 families for an
89% response rate. In the fall of 2002, CDS
fielded its second wave of data collection with
the same children originally interviewed in
CDS-I who were 5 through 18 years of age at
the time of the second wave. Much of the same

information from CDS-I was collected from
parents, teachers, and the children, as well as
new modules addressing issues relevant to the
adolescent stage. The CDS-II resulted in a 91%
response rate.  A third and final wave of the


CDS in 2007/2008 will collect data from
caregivers and approximately 1,677 children
from 1,397 families who will be aged 10-18 at
the time of the interview.


**Section II: Scientific Motivation**

In the past several decades, the U.S. and other
countries have experienced a prolongation of
the transition into adulthood. Youth are no
longer moving quickly from secondary
education into the labor force and independent
economic living. Scientists are becoming
increasingly aware of the fact that the years
from 18-24 are critical for life span
development. It is during this period that
major investments are made in education, and
careers are planned and initiated. For the
PSID, this means that important educational
and occupational transitions are often made
while young adults are still dependent on their
parents, many years before they become family
heads and wives themselves.

Based on the 2003 wave of the PSID, less than
50% of individuals become heads or
wives/”wives” of their own PSID family before
they are 24 years of age.

Although the PSID collects some information
about everyone who is a member of the coresident PSID family, the greatest detail is


**Section III: Study Design**
In 2005, the Child Development Supplement
(CDS) launched a new data collection for the
oldest members of its sample (18 years and
older) with the goal of capturing information
about life changes and experiences during the
“transition into adulthood” years. This period
in the life course is often marked by the events


_**Part 1: Sample**_
The CDS young adults interviewed for the
Transition into Adulthood (TA) study were
initially selected and interviewed for CDS in
1997 when they were in middle childhood and
may have been re-interviewed as adolescents
in 2002-2003 for the second wave of CDS, as
well. Eligibility requirements for the TA
interview were as follows:



collected on the head and wife/”wife”. For
the CDS cohort, without the TA study, this
would result in a large gap in information about
their youth between their last CDS interview in
adolescence and their first interview as a PSID
head or wife/”wife”, meaning a gap in
information about their early adult transitions.
The launching of the Transition into Adulthood
study was motivated by recognition that these
years are marked by choices, changes, and
transitions that have profound lifelong
consequences, but would be missed by the
sample design of the PSID prior to 2005. The TA
study was implemented in 2005 to bridge this

gap.

Based on current literature and theories
guiding research on the adult transitional
years, we designed an interview that built on
the information collected from these children
when they were interviewed as adolescents in
CDS-II and, at the same time, harmonized and
coordinated with the data that will be
collected on them when they are interviewed
as adults in future waves of the core PSID.


of completing one’s education, engagement in
full-time, career-track employment, and
starting a family of one’s own. It is also
characterized by changes in self-identity,
evolving personal values and goals, new
achievements, and shifts in time use.


- CDS sample member, i.e., response in the
initial wave of the CDS in 1997 and a PSID
sample member;

- Eligible for PSID 2005, i.e., associated with a
response PSID family in 2005 (in a few cases the
child and his or her PSID family was nonresponse in 2003 but response in 2005);


- At least 18 years of age during the data
collection period; and

- If 18 years old and living with parents or
other caregivers, graduated from or no longer
attending high school.

During sample development, we learned that
one CDS youth had a severe health condition
that prevented his ability to participate in the
interview, per parental report in the 2005 PSID,
and two CDS youths were incarcerated (IRB
prohibits interviewing in prisons). Eighty-eight
out of 309 (28.5%) CDS youths who were 18
years old and living at home with their parents
were still in high school.


_**Part 2: Questionnaire Development and**_
_**Mode**_

The TA question schedule built on measures
from the adolescent module in CDS-II, relevant
domains in the PSID main study, and new
content appropriate for the subjects’
developmental stage. Jacquelynne Eccles,
Frank Stafford and Bob Schoeni led the
development of the content, with input from
special contributors such as John Schulenberg
and Connie Flanagan. The questionnaire was
programmed in Blaise. We conducted one
pretest, in early July, 2005, to test the Blaise
application functionality, questionnaire length,
and the wording and flow of the questionnaire.

The TA data collection was designed as a
computer-assisted telephone interview,
conducted in the centralized interviewing
facility at the Survey Research Center (SRC) at
the University of Michigan. The sample
management system in the SRC Telephone
Facility offered advantages that were


_**Part 3: Interviewing**_
In early September, 2005, we trained 14
interviewers from SRC’s Telephone Facility on
all aspects of the questionnaire and survey
protocols. The ensuing data collection period
spanned 19 weeks, from September 12, 2005
through February 2, 2006. The Facility was
closed during most of the week of Thanksgiving
(4 days), and for nearly two weeks (13 days)
around the Christmas and New Year holidays.
We were able to interview during one of the
closed days in November and during four of the



The sample was released in two batches (one
at the start of the production period and the
other, three weeks into production), as the
PSID sample lines were finalized. The staggered
release also aided in the mailings of respondent
booklets.

Just prior to sample release for TA production,
we reviewed all TA cases for which the main
family had a non-interview result for PSID 2005.
The purpose of the review was to exclude any
TA sample members for whom the PSID family
was highly upset or hostile during their own
2005 interview. The majority of the final PSID
family refusals in 2005 were excluded from TA
(n=10).


attractive to studies like TA that have hard-toreach samples. The system provides easily
accessible data on productivity by interviewer
and by calling times, allowing us to make
staffing and sample priority decisions on a
weekly and sometimes daily basis. Sample
could be prioritized based on sample
characteristics or call attributes, which helped
not only in juggling cases based on progress in
PSID 2005 data collection and on late-year
birthdays for the 18-year-old participants, but
also based on contact outcomes during the TY
data collection. Interviewers could be
monitored in real-time, helping us to ensure
that questions were read and probed properly,
and that the respondent booklet was correctly
used. The face-to-face meetings with
interviewers at any time during production
were invaluable, especially in helping to
maintain morale during difficult periods of the
study.


13 closed days in December by making special
arrangements.

Generally, the TA participants were contacted
at the address obtained from the main PSID
2005 interviewing effort. At the end of the PSID
main family interview, we asked the PSID
respondent (who, about 10% of the time, was
also the targeted TA sample member) if the TAeligible individual could be reached at the PSID
current main family address, and about 90%
reported in the affirmative. During production,


this information proved very advantageous to
our contact efforts; only 7% of the TA cases
required tracking, and just a little over half of
those were finalized as lost.

Among the 10% of TA individuals who would not
be at the main PSID address in the fall of 2005,
the PSID respondent was able to provide an
address for approximately a third. Almost half
of these required tracking, and contact was
eventually made with all of them.

Overall, the contact information gathered in
the PSID interview proved useful for TA 2005
and will be used for future TA data collections.


**Section IV: Questionnaire Content**

As Table 1 illustrates, the TA instrument
provides a focus on traditional markers of the
transition into adulthood: work, schooling, and
family formation, as well as future
occupational and educational expectations and



Based on family composition information
collected in the main PSID interview, we were
able to identify CDS youth living away at
college. Just prior to the September
interviewer training, a Research Assistant
called these individuals to verify and/or collect
an address and telephone number for the Fall
of 2005. This effort allowed us to make
contact directly with the youth prior to their
moves and to avoid some gate-keeping and
additional calls to the parents during
production.

_**Part 1: Response Rate by Sample Type**_
Eligible TA youth were classified in the 2005
main PSID interview as either living at home
with their parents or caregivers, still
dependent on their parents or caregivers but
living away at college, or living in their own
family unit. We experienced very small


_**Part 2: Response Rate Comparisons with**_
_**Other Studies**_

Prior to the data collection period, we raised
several concerns about the response rate
feasibility for interviews with young adults.
Concerns were as follows: (a) in the CDS-II, the
adolescent cooperation rate was 84%, and
potential continued interest and cooperation in
young adult interviews could be even less; (b)
making contact with young adults would be a
challenge due to the likelihood of increased
variability in their schedules compared to when
they were tied to a secondary school calendar;
(c) PSID splitoff experience has suggested a
potential for gate-keeping by parents, making
direct contact with the young adults difficult,



response variability by sample type: 89.8% of
CDS youth still living with their parents
participated in the study, 90.4% of CDS youth
living away at college took part, and 87.2% of
CDS youth living on their own (PSID
Heads/Wives/”Wives”) responded.


especially those living away at college; (d) high
geographic mobility, as suggested by CPS data,
could pose tracking challenges; and (e) the
newness of the study itself may hinder
cooperation rates—initial waves typically result
in lower response rates than subsequent data
collections. Some of these a priori hypotheses
were supported during data collection, but
overall the response rate for TA was strong,
particularly in comparison to other successful
large scale surveys of young adults and in
comparison to PSID splitoff response rates for
the past four waves.

|**PSID ’99 – ’01 Split-Off Sample**|.82|


**Part 3: Calling Effort and Interview Length**
The 2005 TA study experienced a high call level
effort. A total of 3,355 interviewer hours were
used to fully work all 860 sample cases.

Completed cases required an average (median)
number of 9 calls per interview. Non-response
cases, on the other hand, resulted in an
average (median) number of 35 call attempts
per case. The main contributor to the call
effort was the number of contact attempts
needed to reach the study participant at home.
Unlike the completed cases, a larger
discrepancy among sub-samples emerged for
the non-response. Interviewers made
approximately 5 times as many calls for the
CDS youth who had established their own
households or were living with parents, in
comparison to those youth away at school.

Just under 10% of the cases went through
“advanced tracking”—location efforts
conducted by a special tracking team during
production. Those tracking flagged sample lines
had a tendency to recidivate—the team
conducted repeated tracking throughout
production with an approximate 50% success
rate.

Resistance, on the other hand, was fairly low:
the interviewers flagged 40 cases during the
production period as providing some level of


**Section VI: Using TA Data**
The TA data are freely accessible in the PSID
web-based Data Center at
http://simba.isr.umich.edu/

The data file contains 745 data records, one
record for each response TA sample member.


_**Part 1: Linking TA with Main PSID Data**_
The unique TA identification number
mentioned in the preceding paragraph
(TA050002) is not to be used for any linking
with PSID data; it simply contains sequential
values ranging from 1 through 745 based on the
order in which the TA interviews were
completed.

To link with 2005 PSID family data, match TA
variable TA050003, the 2005 PSID Family



resistance. All resistant cases received a
tailored letter, resulting in 32% conversion (for
reference, the PSID splitoff conversion rate was
32%-37%).

The interview length, defined as the amount of
time spent reading the voluntary participation
statement, administering questions A1 through
M14, and collecting address and contact
information, averaged 57.3 minutes overall,
although it varied significantly by sample type.

TABLE 4: Interview Length by Sample Type

|OFUMs Away at College|62.0 minutes|
|---|---|
|OFUMs Living at Home|58.6 minutes|
|PSID Heads/Wives/”Wives”|43.8 minutes|



This variation in length was partly due to
questionnaire design (fewer questions were
asked of the CDS youth living on their own),
and partly due to differences in life
experiences, which impacted questions asked
about work and school histories.

Participants received $40 for a completed TA
interview. Interviewers reported that the
incentive was well-received, and did not
suggest an increase in the incentive amount.


Each record on the file has a unique, sequential
identification number (TA050002). A total of
955 variables are included (TA050001TA050955).

To link to other waves of the PSID, match to
the individual data as described immediately
above. Since the individual file contains
identifiers for all family data for each


individual, these values can be used to match
with any year’s family data. For example, to
find information about the family in which the
TA respondent was living in 2001, select


_**Part 2: TA Heads/Wives/”Wives” and TA**_

_**OFUMs**_

TA sample members belong to one of two main
groups. The first, TA Heads/Wives/”Wives”, is
comprised of respondents who had become
PSID heads/wives/”wives” by 2005. The
second, TA OFUMs, were also PSID “Other
Family Unit Members”, individuals who had not
established their own households by 2005 and
still resided with parents or other relatives or
were away at college or in the military. The
variable TA050011 indicates the TA’s position in
the main PSID family unit in 2005.

Ninety-five TA respondents (12.8%) had become
PSID heads, wives or “wives” by 2005. To
minimize the burden of completing multiple
interviews within weeks of each other, their TA
questionnaires bypassed the domains of
employment (Section E), income (Section F), a
significant share of health (Section H) and a
few other items, all recently provided by these
respondents during the main PSID interview.
That is to say, data on employment, income,
health, etc. for these TA respondents was
collected using the PSID instrument, but for the
other 650 TA respondents (all of the TA
OFUMs), the TA instrument was used.



ER33601, his or her 2001 Family Interview
Number from the individual file, and match
that with ER17002 on the 2001 family file.


Information for the TA heads, wives and
“wives” was transferred from the main PSID
interview to the equivalent TA variables. See
Table 5 for a complete list of transferred
items.

It is important to note that there are
differences in the questions and codes used in
these domains across the two instruments, and
in some instances recoding for compatibility
was impossible. In that case, the similar items
were transferred to a separate set of variables
in the TA data file (see Table 6 for a
summation). Where recoding could produce
identical items, codebook descriptions contain
the details.

A very few questions in Sections E and H were
neither asked of heads, wives, and “wives” in
the TA interview nor included in the main PSID
interview. An example is question E66
(TA050390). Values for heads, wives and
“wives” were coded 9 if they otherwise fit the
question sequence (i.e., if E64 was answered
“yes”). Similar omissions also received values
of 9 in lieu of 0.

Body mass index (TA050944) and its percentile
status (TA050945) were calculated from H21
and H22, reported weight and height. The
formula and details of these variables’
generation are included in their codebook
descriptions.

A group of five variables concerning education
were built. The first concerns the TA
respondent’s school enrollment status in


combination with achieved educational level
(TA050946). It is followed by two sets of
variables about parents’ education, one set for
each parent.

Using the PSID’s Parent Identification File
(PID), parents who had ever been in the study
were located on the cross-year individual file.
The most recent education information
available on this file was used for years of
completed education (TA050947 for mother and
TA050949 for father). Variables indicating the
wave in which parental education was most
recently asked (TA050948 for mother and
TA050950 for father) were constructed for two
reasons. Firstly, parents may have become
nonresponse at some time during the lifetime
of the TA child. And secondly, even if the
parent is currently in the PSID, education is not
asked in every wave for PSID heads, wives and
“wives”, many of whom are likely to be parents
of TA sample members. Because of these time
lags between the last known educational level
and the present, the recency indicators
highlight that the parental levels should be
used with some degree of caution and may not
reflect current reality.

The TA’s current marital status and
cohabitation situation were jointly recoded to
create a combined-status variable (TA050951)
that, in the absence of family listing
information at the time of the TA interview, is
a useful tool for deducing current living
situation.

Annual earnings (TA050954) were calculated
from the TA’s reports of employment during
the prior calendar year (2004) from amounts
and time units as given at question E46 for
each job (TA050220-TA050221, TA050255TA050256, TA050290-TA050291, TA050325TA050326, and TA050360-TA050361) and then
summed. No attempts were made to impute
missing amounts; if any of the earnings
variables contained missing data, then the total
was computed as missing.

Earnings for 2003 were not asked as part of the
TA interview. Since current-year (2005)
earnings are incomplete, they were not
annualized; almost all of the interviews were
taken during 2005, which creates a shifting
time frame problem for comparison purposes.



Weights for TA 2005 (TA050955) were derived
from the original 1997 CDS weights. For
