**Coverscreen**


**Q1**
Hello, may I please speak with ^NamF ^NamL?


Hello, my name is [IWER NAME] and I am calling from the Survey Research Center at the University of
Michigan. I am calling because we are inviting you to participate in a new study on young people in the United
States. This study is conducted by the same people who do the Family Economics Study and the Child
Development Supplement, both of which you and your family are participants.


We would like to learn more about the experiences of young people as they move into adulthood, what becoming an
adult means today, and what influences young peoples’ decisions. There are questions about schooling, job training,
work, and family, but just as important are questions about your goals and expectations for the future.

continue.


If there is a large gap in the age or you are uncertain that this is the correct R, please suspend and speak
with a Supervisor: "Thank you. The information you have provided differs from what we have in our
