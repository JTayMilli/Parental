TA050001  "RELEASE NUMBER"                   NUM(1.0)

Release Number

Two variables have been reconfigured for Release 3: TA050947 COMPLETED EDUCATION OF MOTHER
and TA050949 COMPLETED EDUCATION OF FATHER. We have assigned a discreet code value: 96 to
represent either that the parent is unknown or they have never been in the study so there
is no education information about them. Users may now identify parents who have 0
education from unknown parents or unknown education.

Release 4: K17C/K17F/K18C/K18F/K19C/K19F were recoded to a 1-digit code frame for public
release, to protect anonimity. A 3-digit code frame is also available for these variables
in separate files to qualified users under special contractual arrangements with the PSID;
for more information, contact us at PSIDstaff@umich.edu.

Release 5: Suppression of Beale code for urbanicity (TA050953). Fixes to some variable
labels for consistency across waves and across studies.

To create the scale, the items are rescored as follows:
A response of
'All of the Time' = 4 points,
'Most of the Time' = 3 points,
'Some of the Time' = 2 points,
'A Little of the Time' = 1 point, and
'None of the Time' = 0 points.

The scores are then summed; a score of 13 or higher indicates sensitivity around the
threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific
distress.

This variable may be based on fewer than the above six variables. Items containing "don't
know" and "refused" responses are not included in the calculation of the scale.

This scale was developed by Dr. Ronald Kessler, Professor of Healthcare Policy at Harvard
Medical School.

TA050944  "BODY MASS INDEX"                   NUM(4.1)
Body Mass Index

This variable was calculated as follows:

BMI =[ ( Weight in Pounds) / (Height in inches) x (Height in inches)] x 703

Height and weight values were taken from the following questions:

TA050741 H21. Weight--Total Pounds
TA050742 H22. Height--Feet Component
TA050743 H22. Height--Inches Component

Any extreme results, i.e., BMI of less than 15.0 or greater than 59.9, were recoded to 99,
since in such cases the accuracy of height and/or weight values is highly doubtful.

Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to
both adult men and women. BMI categories are:

Normal weight = 18.5-24.9
Overweight = 25.0-29.9
Obese = BMI of 30.0 or greater

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes. However, code values
have been increased by one; that is, code 1 here is equivalent to code 0 as originally
used by Beale and Ross. Metropolitan status is that announced by the Office of Management
and Budget in June 1983, when the current population criteria were first applied to
results of the 1980 Census. Adjacency was determined by both physical boundary adjacency
and a finding that at least 2 percent of the employed labor force in the nonmetropolitan
county commuted to metropolitan central counties.

This variable is suppressed (filled with zeroes) in the public release file to protect the
anonymity of respondents. The data are available in a separate file to qualified users
