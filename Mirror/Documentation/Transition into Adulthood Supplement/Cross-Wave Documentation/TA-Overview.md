# The Child Development Supplement Transition into Adulthood Study Overview

In 2005, the PSID began a new study called “Transition into Adulthood”. This study was designed to collect
information from all children who had participated in the Child Development Supplement who had turned age 18
and had completed high school and had families still active in PSID. The study collects data on young adult
developmental pathways and outcomes, filling a gap between the detailed information about development from
early and middle childhood through adolescence (as measured in CDS-I, CDS-II, and CDS-III), and the detailed
information on adulthood once these youth assume the role of economic independence and become PSID heads
and wives.

In the 2005 pilot interviews, data were gathered via a 44-minute computer assisted telephone interview from n=745
CDS young adults aged 18 and older who had finished or left high school on health and emotional well-being, time
use, community involvement, self identity and perception, expectations for the future, family, peer, and romantic
relationships, work, schooling, and more. The interview domains coordinated with the CDS adolescent measures
and the PSID employment and health measures, and additionally provided new questions reflective of the
uniqueness of this developmental stage.

These data are now available in the PSID Data Center. The data may be used for cross-sectional analysis, or can
be linked automatically using the Data Center to other waves of the CDS to study development from early
childhood through early adulthood. The data can also be linked to all waves of the PSID using the 1968 family
identification variable to study intergenerational connections in outcomes such as education, and the effects of
family characteristics on development.

A second wave of data collection on these same young adults and those who had newly turned age 18 and left high
school by 2007 started in August 2007 and concluded in March 2008. There were n=1,118 interviews taken with a
90% response rate. These data will be available by March 2009. Additional funding is being sought to continue the
Transition into Adulthood study until all CDS children have reached eligibility and have completed an interview.
