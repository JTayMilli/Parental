I. Introduction

These files contain data and documentation from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) 2023 Parent Identification File. This file, pid23_readme.pdf, provides
information about the contents of all the files in this package. See the PSID website for a
description of sample SAS and SPSS programs needed to merge the family-year data
with the cross-year individual data to create a traditional cross-year family-individual file
or use the Data Center. It is recommended that one carefully reviews this material before
proceeding with any work using the data files.

A. DATA

There is one data file:

- The 2023 Parent Identification File.

The 2023 Parent Identification File contains details about persons living in a PSID family
at the time of the interview in any wave from 1968 through 2023 and his or her biological
or adoptive parents. Additionally, persons who have never been in the study but who
have been identified as children of someone who has are included.

The data are in raw ASCII form. Refer to one of the associated program files - SAS,
SPSS or STATA -- for record format layout information, variable names (or numbers),
variable labels (or names), and missing data codes.

B. SAS, SPSS, and STATA

These files contain SAS, SPSS, and STATA statements providing information about the
variables in the data files. The naming conventions are the same as for the data files:
pid23.sas contains SAS statements, pid23.sps contains SPSS statements, and pid23.do
contains equivalent STATA statements.

The statements provide variable names and locations and variable labels. No variables in
the collection have assigned missing data codes. One should check the codebook for
each variable one is including in oneâ€™s analysis to determine if any of the codes should be
defined as missing.

The SAS, SPSS, and STATA statements are NOT intended to represent completed and
full programs for the respective statistical program packages to run extracts, analyses, etc.
One must provide all other package-specific statements needed to complete a program.
