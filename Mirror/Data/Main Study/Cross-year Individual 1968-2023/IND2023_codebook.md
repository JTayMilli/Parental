ER30001  "1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER"                NUM(4.0)

1968 Interview Number (1968 ID Number)

This variable is the 1968 family ID number. The combination of this variable and Person

Number (ER30002) provides unique identification for each individual on the data file.

Individuals associated with families from the Latino and Immigrant samples, added to the
PSID in 1990/1992 and 1997/1999, and 2017 respectively, were assigned 1968 IDs so that

they, too, have unique identifiers compatible with the PSID structure for the core (SRC

and Census) sample.

school. A code value of 16 indicates that this individual is at least a college graduate.

about completed education was not asked annually for them as it was for other family unit

information was asked only when the Head most recently became a new Head. Recency of

Heads' data can be ascertained by searching backward through the series variables for

whether the family has a new Head (1972 V2971, 1971 V2165, 1970 V1461, and 1969 V791).

Education was asked of all Heads in 1968. The values for this variable represent the

This individual was not eligible for the interview and
became main family nonresponse because the Head or Wife,
whichever is sample, died.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

Other office error

This sample individual moved out of the 1972 main family
and was eligible for interviewing but the reason for
nonresponse is NA.

Individual moved out of the 1972 main family and was not
eligible for interviewing because he/she was either

nonsample or too young.

The Head or Wife of this FU, whichever is sample, united
with another FU; this individual was not eligible for the
interview and therefore became nonresponse.

This individual had not been born or moved in by the time

of the 1972 interview (ER30091>0 and ER30092=0);

1969 Individual Weight, Updated for 1972

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1972 panel family.

Sample members born into the family in 1972 receive either the average of the Head's and

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

Those sample members returning to a panel family after becoming nonresponse receive the

same weight that they had in the last year that they had nonzero data. Refer to Section I,

Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for details on the weights

themselves.

1974 Individual Weight

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1974 response family.

Sample members born into the family in 1974 receive either the average of the Head's and

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

For those sample members either not yet part of the family in 1969 but present by 1973 or

who were main family nonresponse in 1969 and moved back into the panel in 1973, the most

recent weight is brought forward to these positions. Refer to Section I, Part 5, of the

guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for details on the weights themselves.

1974 Individual Weight, Updated for 1975

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1975 panel family.

Sample members born into the family in 1975 receive either the average of the Head's and

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

Those sample members returning to a panel family after becoming nonresponse receive the

same weight that they had in the last year that they had nonzero data. Refer to Section I,

Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for details on the weights

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade and was no longer in

school. A code value of 16 indicates that this individual is at least a college graduate.

This variable contains values for 1976 Heads (from 1976 V4684) and Wives/"Wives" (from

1976 V4695 or 1976 V4755), although information about completed education is not asked

annually for them as it is for other family unit members. Recency of Heads' data (i.e.,

whether questions were asked in 1975 or 1976) can be ascertained by the value of the

variable for whether the family has a new Head (1976 V4658). Education information was

obtained for all Heads in 1975. Education information was obtained for all Wives/"Wives"

in 1975 and was collected again in 1976 (V4755) if the Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaire was

asked. If the Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaire was not administered, then V4695 was used for

Wife's/"Wife's" education and its recency is indicated by 1976 V4694. Values of 17 from

1976 V4684, V4895 or V4755 were recoded to 16 here to ensure comparability of Heads and

1974 Individual Weight, Updated for 1976

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1976 panel family.

Sample members born into the family in 1976 receive either the average of the Head's and

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

Those sample members returning to a panel family after becoming nonresponse receive the

same weight that they had in the last year that they had nonzero data. Refer to Section I,

Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for details on the weights

themselves.

This variable contains values for 1977 Heads (from 1977 V5608) and Wives/"Wives" (from

as it is for other family unit members. Recency of Heads' data can be ascertained by

searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family has a new Head

(1977 V5578 and 1976 V4658). Education information was obtained for all Heads in 1975.

Recency of Wives'/"Wives'" data can be ascertained by searching backward through the

series of variables for whether the family has a new Wife/"Wife" (1977 V5566 and 1976

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

Other office error

This sample individual moved out of the 1977 main family
and was eligible for interviewing but the reason for
nonresponse is NA.

Individual moved out of the 1977 main family and was not
eligible for interviewing because he/she was either

nonsample or too young.

The Head or Wife of this FU, whichever is sample, united
with another FU; this individual was not eligible for the
interview and therefore became nonresponse.

This individual had not been born or moved in by the time

of the 1977 interview (ER30218>0 and ER30219=0);

individual from Immigrant or Latino samples

(ER30001=3001-3511,4001-4851,7001-9308)

1974 Individual Weight, Updated for 1977

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1977 panel family.

Sample members born into the family in 1977 receive either the average of the Head's and

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

Those sample members returning to a panel family after becoming nonresponse receive the

same weight that they had in the last year that they had nonzero data. Refer to Section I,

K49. What is the highest grade or year of school (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1979

interview. A code value of 16 indicates that this individual is at least a college
graduate. This variable contains values for 1979 Heads (from 1979 V6754) and Wives/"Wives"

(from 1979 V6713), although information about completed education is not asked annually

for them as it is for other family unit members. Recency of Heads' data can be ascertained

by searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family has a new

Head (1979 V6724, 1978 V6127, 1977 V5578, and 1976 V4658). Education information was

obtained for all Heads in 1975. Recency of Wives'/"Wives'" data can be ascertained by

searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family has a new

Wife/"Wife" (1979 V6712, 1978 V6115, 1977 V5566, and 1976 V4694). Education information

was obtained for all Wives/"Wives" in 1975 and was collected again in 1976 (V4755) if the
Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaire was asked. Values of 17 from 1979 V6713 or V6754 were

recoded to 16 here to ensure comparability of Heads and Wives/"Wives" with other family

unit members.

K52. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1980

interview. A code value of 16 indicates that this individual is at least a college
graduate. This variable contains values for 1980 Heads (from 1980 V7387) and Wives/"Wives"

(from 1980 V7346), although information about completed education is not asked annually

for them as it is for other family unit members. Recency of Heads' data can be ascertained

by searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family has a new

Head (1980 V7357, 1979 V6724, 1978 V6127, 1977 V5578, and 1976 V4658). Education

information was obtained for all Heads in 1975. Recency of Wives'/"Wives'" data can be

ascertained by searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family

has a new Wife/"Wife" (1980 V7345, 1979 V6712, 1978 V6115, 1977 V5566, and 1976 V4694).

Education information was obtained for all Wives/"Wives" in 1975 and was collected again
in 1976 (V4755) if the Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaire was asked. Values of 17 from 1980

V7346 or V7387 were recoded to 16 here to ensure comparability of Heads and Wives/"Wives"

with other family unit members.

K46. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1981

interview. A code value of 16 indicates that this individual is at least a college
graduate. This variable contains values for 1981 Heads (from 1981 V8039) and Wives/"Wives"

(from 1981 V7998), although information about completed education is not asked annually

for them as it is for other family unit members. Recency of Heads' data can be ascertained

by searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family has a new

Head (1981 V8009, 1980 V7357, 1979 V6724, 1978 V6127, 1977 V5578, and 1976 V4658).

Education information was obtained for all Heads in 1975. Recency of Wives'/"Wives'" data

can be ascertained by searching backward through the series of variables for whether the

family has a new Wife/"Wife" (1981 V7997, 1980 V7345, 1979 V6712, 1978 V6115, 1977 V5566,

and 1976 V4694). Education information was obtained for all Wives/"Wives" in 1975 and was

collected again in 1976 (V4755) if the Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaire was asked. Values of

17 from 1981 V7998 or V8039 were recoded to 16 here to ensure comparability of Heads and

Wives/"Wives" with other family unit members.

K47. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1982

interview.

This variable contains values for 1982 Heads (from 1982 V8663) and Wives/"Wives" (from

1982 V8622), although information about completed education is not asked annually for them

as it is for other family unit members. Recency of Heads' data can be ascertained by

searching backward through the series of variables for whether the family has a new Head

(1982 V8633, 1981 V8009, 1980 V7357, 1979 V6724, 1978 V6127, 1977 V5578, and 1976 V4658).

Education information was obtained for all Heads in 1975. Recency of Wives'/"Wives'" data

can be ascertained by searching backward through the series of variables for whether the

family has a new Wife/"Wife" (1982 V8621, 1981 V7997, 1980 V7345, 1979 V6712, 1978 V6115,

1977 V5566, and 1976 V4694). Education information was obtained for all Wives/"Wives" in

1975 and was collected again in 1976 (V4755) if the Wives'/"Wives'" questionnaire was

asked. Values of 17 from 1982 V8622 or V8663 were recoded to 16 here to ensure

comparability of Heads and Wives/"Wives" with other family unit members.

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

Those sample members returning to a panel family after becoming nonresponse receive the

same weight that they had in the last year that they had nonzero data. Refer to Section I,

Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for details on the weights

themselves.

1984 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1983 Head for any individual whose 1984

sequence number (ER30430) is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for

example, if the 1983 Head is no longer present at the time of the 1984 interview, his or

her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1984 Head also is coded 10. Therefore, to

select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

assumptions: if the month of birth is NA (ER30433=99), July is assumed; if the date of

interview is NA (V10416=9999), assume July for birth month and that July birthdays did not

yet take place; if the day of the interview is less than the fifteenth day of the month,

assume that birthdays in the same month did not yet take place. Consistency with ER30432,

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

interview.

This variable contains values for 1985 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1985 family-level

data. For 1985 Heads, these were computed as follows: if V11959 is greater than zero, then

completed education equals 12 plus the value for V11959. For the remaining cases, a value

of 1 at V11945 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals

V11948 plus V11953. Education was asked for all Heads in 1985. Wives/"Wives were treated

similarly: if V12314 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the

value for V12314. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V12300 was converted to a value

of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V12303 plus V12308. Education was asked for

1984 Weight, Updated for 1985

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1985 response family.

Sample members born into the family in 1985 receive either the average of the Head's and

spouse's weights or, in the event of a single Head, the child receives the Head's weight.

For those sample members either not yet part of the family in 1979 but present by 1984 or

who were main family nonresponse in 1979 and moved back into the panel in 1984, the most

recent weight is brought forward to these positions. Refer to Section I, Part 5, of the

guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for details on the weights themselves.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1985 Head for any individual whose 1986

sequence number (ER30499) is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for

example, if the 1985 Head is no longer present at the time of the 1986 interview, his or

her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1986 Head also is coded 10. Therefore, to

select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

ER30513  "COMPLETED EDUCATION          86"      NUM(2.0)
G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1986

interview.

This variable contains values for 1986 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1986 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. For 1986 Heads, these were computed as follows: if

V13582 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V13582.

For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V13568 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,

completed education equals V13571 plus V13576. For the recency of the data, see family
level V13668. Wives/"Wives were treated similarly: if V13512 is greater than zero, then

completed education equals 12 plus the value for V13512. For the remaining cases, a value

of 1 at V13503 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals

V13505 plus V13508. For the recency of the data, see family-level V13669.

ER30537  "RELATIONSHIP TO HEAD         87"      NUM(2.0)

1987 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1986 Head for any individual whose 1987

sequence number (ER30536) is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for

example, if the 1986 Head is no longer present at the time of the 1987 interview, his or

her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1987 Head also is coded 10. Therefore, to

select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

numbers (ER30536=01).

ER30549  "COMPLETED EDUCATION          87"      NUM(2.0)
G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1987

interview.

This variable contains values for 1987 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1987 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. For 1987 Heads, these were computed as follows: if

V14629 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V14629.

For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V14615 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise,

completed education equals V14618 plus V14623. For the recency of the data, see family
level V14715. Wives/"Wives were treated similarly: if V14559 is greater than zero, then

completed education equals 12 plus the value for V14559. For the remaining cases, a value

of 1 at V14550 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals

V14552 plus V14555. For the recency of the data, see family-level V14716.

assumptions: if the month of birth is NA (ER30539=99), July is assumed; if the date of

interview is NA (V14111=9999), assume July and that July birthdays did not yet take place;

if the day of the interview is less than the fifteenth day of the month, assume that

birthdays in the same month did not yet take place. Consistency with ER30538, reported

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1988

interview. A code value of 17 indicates that this individual has completed at least some

postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1988 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from

family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked annually

for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1988 Heads, these were computed as

follows: if V16103 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value

for V16103. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V16089 was converted to a value of

12. Otherwise, completed education equals V16092 plus V16097. For the recency of the data,
see family-level V16190. Wives/"Wives were treated similarly: if V16033 is greater than

zero, then completed education equals 12 plus the value for V16033. For the remaining

This variable is nonzero only for sample members associated with a 1988 response family.

Sample members born into the family in 1988 receive either the average of the Head's and

For those sample members either not yet part of the family in 1979 but present by 1984 or

who were main family nonresponse in 1979 and moved back into the panel in 1984, the most

recent weight is brought forward to these positions. Refer to Section I, Part 5, of the

ER30620  "COMPLETED EDUC-IND          89"      NUM(2.0)
G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1989

interview. A code value of 17 indicates that this individual has completed at least some

postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1989 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from

1989 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked

annually for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1989 Heads, these were

computed as follows: if V17500 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12

plus the value for V17500. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V17486 was converted

to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V17489 plus V17494. For the

recency of the data, see family-level V17568. Wives/"Wives were treated similarly, using

family-level variables. For 1989, see V17421-V17430. If V17430 is greater than zero, then

completed education equals 12 plus the value for V17430. For the remaining cases, a value

of 1 at V17421 was converted to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals

V17423 plus V17426. For the recency of the data, see family-level V17569.

1990 Relationship to Head

Note that these relationships are those to the 1989 Head for any individual whose 1990

sequence number (ER30643) is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for

example, if the 1989 Head is no longer present at the time of the 1990 interview, his or

her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1990 Head also is coded 10. Therefore, to

select current Heads, the user must select those coded 10 in this variable whose sequence

numbers (ER30643=01).

ER30657  "COMPLETED EDUC-IND          90"      NUM(2.0)
G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1990

interview. A code value of 17 indicates that this individual has completed at least some

postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1990 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from

1990 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked

annually for them as it is for other family unit members. For 1990 Heads, these were

computed as follows: if V18831 is greater than zero, then completed education equals 12

plus the value for V18831. For the remaining cases, a value of 1 at V18817 was converted

to a value of 12. Otherwise, completed education equals V18820 plus V18825. For the
recency of the data, see family-level V18919. Wives/"Wives" were treated similarly, using

family-level variables. For 1990, see 18752-V18761. If V18761 is greater than zero, then

completed education equals 12 plus the value for V18761. For

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1991

interview. A code value of 17 indicates that this individual has completed at least some

postgraduate work. This variable contains values for 1991 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from

1991 family-level data, although information about completed education is not asked

annually for them as it is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the

family-level variables V20198 (Head) and V20199 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads

and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family
level variable is the grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is
12. Education was re-asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level V20219

(Heads) and V20220 (Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this information.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

interview.

This variable contains values for 1992 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1992 family-level

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

V21504 (Head) and V21505 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re
asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level V21525 (Heads) and V21526

The values for this variable represent the actual age of the individual in years on his or

birth (ER30737-ER30738) and the date of interview (V20648) using the following

assumptions: if the month of birth is NA (ER30737=99), July is assumed; if the date of

interview is NA (V20648=9999), assume July and that July birthdays did not yet take place;

if the day of the interview is less than the fifteenth day of the month, assume that

birthdays in the same month did not yet take place. Consistency with ER30736, reported

age, has not been forced.

These are defined in more detail in Section I, Part 1, of the guide to the 1993 family

data, 93GUIDE.PDF; but, briefly, we followed all nonresponse from 1991, reattempted

interviews with LNPS sample members not successfully interviewed in 1990, and selected a

subset of core sample individuals who were nonresponse by 1990. We also continued to

follow nonsample elderly, just as in 1991. Nonsample persons who were age 64 by 1991 were

added to the age-eligible pool for 1992.

interview.

This variable contains values for 1993 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1993 family-level

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

V23333 (Head) and V23334 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re
asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level V23339 (Heads) and V23340

variables ER30765-ER30769. The set of questions was asked about individuals from the

Latino sample in order to determine whether they had a chance of being selected for the

core sample, an issue in the creation of the 1990-1992 combined core-Latino weights (1990

ER30688, 1991 ER30732 and 1992 ER30805). Cases with missing data on ER30672-ER30676 or

ER30765-ER30769 were imputed proportionally. The proportions were based on the

distribution within each Latino subgroup, using only cases with nonmissing data. This

variable was updated for individuals not present in the previous year who moved into the

study in 1991 and 1992. This is a nonissue for nonsample movers-in, but a few Latino

sample individuals had "appeared" after 1990; that is, they had been in the 1990 family

but their existence was not discovered until 1991 or later. If such persons were born

since 1968 and information about their parents was available, then that information was

used to assign codes here. If, however, they were already living by 1968, it was necessary

to impute as mentioned above. Children born into the sample after 1990 received values

based on their parents' information if known; if parental data regarding whereabouts in

1968 was missing, then values here were imputed.

Yes, this individual (or at least one parent, if

individual was born in 1968 or later) was in the U.S. in

1968 and thus was eligible for the core sample

No, this individual (or neither parent, if individual was

born in 1968 or later) was not in the U.S. in 1968 and

thus was ineligible for the core sample

ER31988  "ETHNICITY ELIGIBILITY FOR LNPS"           NUM(1.0)

Latino National Political Survey Eligibility: Reported Ethnicity within LNPS Sampling Area

This variable was used in the creation of the 1990-1993 combined core-Latino weights (1990

ER30688, 1991 ER30732, 1992 ER30805, and 1993 ER30866). If the individual is core, it

indicates whether the family to which this individual belonged in 1990 had a chance of

inclusion in the LNPS because of ethnic affiliation of any family member living in an LNPS

sampling area. If the individual was not in the study in 1990 but subsequently moved in,

the indicator for the family into which he or she moved was assigned. For Latino sample

individuals, the values indicate the ethnic affiliation of the family member who served as

the respondent for the LNPS. This variable indicates the actual ethnic affiliation of

persons, not the ethnic designation of their area of residence. Thus, a Mexican-American

living in Miami (a Cuban-American LNPS sampling area) still receives a value of 1 for this

variable. For further information about the LNPS sample design, see Section I, Part 13, of

the 1990 Documentation. Both sample and nonsample members have values here. Unfortunately,

after the 1968-1993 individual data were released we discovered that values for all Latino

cases were missing from the file. These cases were filled with zeroes.

the three LNPS sampling areas the individual lived in 1989. This information was available

for all Latinos, but data were missing for a few core cases. Those 1990 core cases missing

information about state and county in 1989 were assigned 1990 location as a proxy.

Similarly, some 1992 and 1993 core recontacts were also missing information from 1989.

State and county data from 1992 and 1993 were used as proxies. See Section I, Part 5, of

This variable is generated by selecting individuals whose values for the Reason for Non

81-89 (mover-out deceased). Also included are those who moved out of a responding family

or institution but did not join another in that same wave (mover-out non-response).

Additionally, because Person Number (ER30002) was a proxy for Sequence Number in the 1968

wave, those core sample spouses who moved out or died in the year prior to that

interview, i.e., whose person numbers equal 227 or 228, are included. Note the separate

ER32005  "WTR EVER OUT OF STUDY 1 YEAR OR MORE"        NUM(1.0)

Whether Individual Has Stayed Out of the Panel for a Year or More

This variable is generated by selecting core individuals with any year's ID number

equaling zero from 1969 through the present. Main family nonresponse for the current year

are included here, as well as nonresponse from other years. Mover-out nonresponse,

however, must have moved out and stayed out for at least one wave, or died in a previous

year in order to have any zero data at all on the file.

For Latino individuals, the yearly ID numbers were checked for zeroes from 1990 through

1995. Individuals associated with Latino recontact families that were never interviewed

until 1992 are included in code 3. The ID numbers of 97/99 Immigrant individuals from the

portion of the sample first interviewed in 1997 were checked from 1999 through the

present; persons from the 1999 sample addition were checked from 2001 forward.

The ID numbers of 17/19 Immigrant individuals from the portion of the sample first

interviewed in 2017 (ER30001=4001-4462) were checked through 2019. Persons from the 2019

sample addition (ER30001=4700-4851) will have a value of 6 as of 2019 wave (their year one

interview).

ER32006  "WHETHER SAMPLE OR NONSAMPLE"             NUM(1.0)

Whether Individual Is Sample

This variable not only indicates persons who were sample members but also flags nonsample

members who were designated as followable. Thus far in PSID history, two such nonsample

groups exist: nonsample elderly individuals, followed from 1990 through 1995, and

nonsample parents of sample children if the children were under age 18, followed from 1994

through 2003.

Initially, the nonsample elderly have person numbers of 170 and higher and were aged 64 or

older at the time of the 1989 interview and expected to be at least age 65 by the time of

the 1990 interview. In each subsequent wave through 1995, a nonsample individual who was

expected to be at least 65 years old by the time of the next interview was added to the

group. Refer to Section I, Part 1, of the Guides to the 1990 and subsequent codebooks for

further details.

Nonsample parents also have person numbers of 170 or greater. Initially, all such parents

were designated in advance of the 1994 interview if any of their sample children were

under age 18. These parents were followed until the youngest sample child reached age 25.

As births of new sample members occurred from 1994 through 2003, their nonsample parent

was made followable.

Beginning in 1994, children who were born since the initial interview for the sample to

which they belonged and who carried the "PSID gene", that is, who had at least one sample

parent but who did not move into a responding PSID family at birth, were designated moved
in sample members. Such children were assigned person numbers of 170 and higher but have

individual weights for years when they are present in the PSID and otherwise fall under

all PSID rules for sample members.

Some individuals whose cohort years are 1968,1997 or 1999 and whose family met similar
eligibility criteria to the immigrant refresher sample added in 2017/2019 became sample

themselves as of 2019. Those individuals have a value of 4 on this variable.

ER32007  "YEAR OF MOST RECENT NONRESPONSE"           NUM(4.0)

Most Recent Year of Nonresponse, Including Institutionalized Individuals

The most recent year of nonresponse is coded here. All individuals who are currently

nonresponse have code values of 2023 here. Individuals who became nonresponse in 1972, for

example, but returned to a responding FU in, say, 1990, have values of 1990 for this

variable and values of 1972 for ER32008. The term "nonresponse" here includes those

individuals who have moved to institutions, are not followed for interview, but who are

tracked until the time when they set up their own households.

Note that values for main Latino sample individuals (ER30001=7001-9043) are only

calculated for years when the Latino sample was active, that is, 1990 through 1995.

Nonresponse individuals from the Latino recontact sample (ER30001=9044-9308) can have

values in the range 1992-1995.

Similarly, values for 97 Immigrant sample individuals begin with 1997. Those from the

1999 sample addition (ER30001=3442-3511) begin at 1999.

Values for the 17 Immigrant sample (ER30001=4001-4462) individuals begin with 2017. Those

First Year of Nonresponse, Including Institutionalized Individuals

The first year of nonresponse is coded here. In the case of main family nonresponse, this

wave's data contain zeroes. For mover-out nonresponse, this wave's data contain some

information, including part-year income data. The next wave's data contain zeroes unless,

of course, the individual returned to a responding FU in that wave or remained in an

institution. If the individual became nonresponse in the current wave, then the code value

here equals that for the previous variable (ER32007).

The term "nonresponse" here includes those individuals who have moved to institutions, are

not followed for interview, but who are tracked until the time when they set up their own

households.

Note that values for main Latino sample individuals (ER30001=7001-9043) are only

calculated for years when the Latino sample was active, that is, 1990 through 1995.

Nonresponse individuals from the Latino recontact sample (ER30001=9044-9308) can have

values in the range 1992-1995.

Similarly, values for 97 Immigrant sample individuals begin with 1997. Those from the 1999

sample addition (ER30001=3442-3511) begin at 1999.

Values for the 17 Immigrant sample individuals begin with 2017 (ER30001=4001-4462) .

ER32009  "1968 ID OF MOTHER"                  NUM(4.0)

1968 Interview Number (1968 ID Number) of Individual's Mother

The actual 1968 ID number (the family-level identifier which, when combined with person

number, uniquely identifies an individual) of the individual's natural mother is coded.

These data were coded for all children whose births were reported in the retrospective

birth histories gathered about their mothers in waves 1985-2023. For a detailed

description of the types of people about whom birth history information was gathered, see

the 1985-2023 Childbirth and Adoption History File Documentation, Section I.

Additionally, individual identifiers linking mother and child were coded in other ways:

mother's identifiers for all individuals in responding families in 1983 and 1984, for
Heads and Spouse/Partners in the 1988 parent supplemental sequence, for children who

received support from absent parents in 1997, for children with mothers in the FU in 1997
2011, and by PSID staff during family composition editing. The 1988 Time and Money
Transfers data also yielded some information about children of Heads and Spouse/Partners,

and the 1997 support supplement indicated children to whom support was given by a parent

in the FU. More recently, the 2013 Rosters and Transfers data supplied information about

children of Heads and Spouse/Partners. For further details see the documentation for the

cumulative Parent Identification File, one of the PSID's family history files.

The values for this variable indicate the birth weight in ounces as collected in the 1985
2023 birth histories of this individual's mother or father. The questions for 1985 asked

only whether the birth weight was under 5 1/2 pounds, but those from 1986 on asked the

actual birth weight. For a detailed description of the types of people about whom birth

history information was gathered and the handling of multiple reports, see the 1985-2023

Childbirth and Adoption History File Documentation, Section I. In 1985 when retrospective

birth histories were collected, birth weights were asked about all children. However, in

each wave from 1986 on, birth weight was asked only if the child had been born since

January 1 of the prior calendar year. For individuals who were continuously in the study,

this presents no problem because births were collected more or less as they happened, but

when an individual is new to the study or returns after a period of nonresponse, birth

weights for his or her older children are missing. This affects almost no born-in sample

children and so should present minimal analytic obstruction.

1968 Interview Number (1968 ID Number) of Individual's Father

The actual 1968 ID number (the family-level identifier which, when combined with person

number, uniquely identifies an individual) of the individual's natural father is coded.

These data were taken from the father's retrospective birth history information gathered

in 1985-2023. For a detailed description of the types of people about whom birth history

information was gathered, see the 1985-2023 Childbirth and Adoption History File

Documentation, Section I.

Additionally, individual identifiers linking father and child were coded in other ways:

father's identifiers for Heads and Spouse/Partners in the 1988 parent supplemental

sequence, for children who received support from absent parents in 1997, for children with

fathers in the FU in 1997-2011, and by PSID staff during family composition editing. The

1988 Time and Money Transfers data also yielded some information about children of Heads

and wives/"wives", and the 1997 support supplement indicated children outside the FU to

whom support was given by a parent in the FU. More recently, the 2013 Rosters and
Transfers data supplied information about children of Heads and Spouse/Partners. For

further details see the documentation for the cumulative Parent Identification File, one

of the PSID's family history files.

ER32052  "YEAR THIS INDIVIDUAL'S COHORT BEGAN"         NUM(4.0)

Year this individual's cohort began

The study has added several cohort refresher samples during the duration of the project
including the Latino, the 1997/1999 Immigrant refresher and the 2017/2019 Immigrant

refresher samples. This summary variable: YEAR THIS INDIVIDUAL'S COHORT BEGAN (ER32052)

will indicate which year this individual's original family was first added to the study.

In past waves, this was easily indicated by the range of the 68ID Interview Number

(ER30001), however with the introduction of the Multiplicity sample in 2019 using the 68ID

Interview Number alone is no longer sufficient.

The Multiplicity sample families are derived from the most recent Immigrant refresher

sample added in 2017 (ER30001=4001-4462 and ER32052=2017). They are the adult parents,

children, or sibling families who did not share the same Housing Unit as their nominator

family and were screened as eligible and added to the study in 2019. Because these

families (the 2017 Immigrant and the 2019 Multiplicity sample) are interconnected they

must share the same 68ID Interview Number (ER30001=4001-4462) but YEAR THIS INDIVIDUAL'S

COHORT BEGAN will equal 2019 (ER32052=2019) for the Multiplicity sample which indicates

the year their original family first entered the study.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1994

interview. A code value of 17 indicates that this individual has completed at least some

postgraduate work.

This variable contains values for 1994 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1994 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED

but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade

completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of

all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The codes below indicate the extent to which

this attempt was successful for 1994. The Medicare data are available under special

Whether Eligible to be Followed in 1994

Individuals with values of 1 for this variable comprise the group selected to be

interviewed in 1994. This included sample members who were interviewed in 1993 including

children under age 18, the nonsample elderly, and nonsample parents of sample children

expected to be under age 18 at the time of the 1994 interview. Also included are those

selected for recontact in 1994, a group that includes nonresponse sample members of all

ages and nonresponse, nonsample parents whose sample children met the age criterion above.

Additionally, children born since 1968 (for the core sample) or since 1990 (for the Latino

sample) who were not born into the study but whose parents are sample members were also

designated as sample members.

All told, there are three changes in followability from 1993:

a). persons who did not move into a responding family at birth but who have a sample

parent are now considered sample members and hence are followable,

b). sample members are followable from birth onward, and

c). nonsample parents of young sample children are followable.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1994 Head for any individual whose 1995

sequence number (ER33202) is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for

example, if the 1994 Head is no longer present at the time of the 1995 interview, his or

her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1995 Head also is coded 10. Therefore, to

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1995

interview.

This variable contains values for 1995 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1995 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED

but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade

completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of

all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

This variable updates PSID access to Medicare records begun in 1990 in conjunction with

the 1990 Self-Administered Questionnaire (SAQ) described in Section I, Part 8 of the 1990

Documentation. Part of the SAQ's purpose was to collect Medicare participant numbers from

eligible individuals in order that the PSID could request their Medicare records from the

Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The codes below indicate the extent to which

this attempt was successful for 1995. The Medicare data are available under special

contractual arrangements. For more information, contact us by e-mail at

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

This individual became a followable non-sample parent
(had baby) in this wave. Because the PSID predetermines
followability before entering the field each wave, he/she

was not followed.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact;
paper coversheet(s) missing; no name or identifying

information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous

office error (does not include codes 1-54 above or codes

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1996

interview.

This variable contains values for 1996 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1996 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED

but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade

completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of

all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

ER33415  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       97"      NUM(2.0)
G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1997

interview.

This variable contains values for 1997 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1997 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED

but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade

completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of

all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

Whether Eligible to be Followed in 1997

Individuals with values of 1 for this variable comprise the group selected to be

interviewed in 1997. Recontact interviews were attempted for persons who were followable

nonresponse in 1996 (the nonsample elderly and the Latino sample continued to be

excluded).

In 1997, the SEO/Census sample was drastically cut. At the eleventh hour, some family

units were "revived" for interview if the Head's race was Black and the family contained

children aged 12 and younger. Most of these family units were response in 1996, although

a few 1995 response-1996 nonresponse that met the race and age criteria were also included

as recontacts.

Beginning in 1997, the follow status of nonsample parents selected from 1994 forward

because at least one of their sample children was under age 18 was changed to a value of 5

if the youngest such child had reached age 25 by the time of the parental 1997 interview.

Eligible persons were response in 1995 or 1996 and otherwise met the criteria for

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

This individual became a followable non-sample parent
(had baby) in this wave. Because the PSID predetermines
followability before entering the field each wave, he/she

was not followed.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact;
paper coversheet(s) missing; no name or identifying

information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous

office error (does not include codes 1-54 above or codes

91-99 below)

Individual connected with the Latino sample

due to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped
beginning in 1997.

This non-sample elderly individual was followed during
the period 1990 through 1995. If he or she was not
living with a followable individual in 1996, then he or
she was dropped from the study in 1996. Other nonfollowable individuals connected with dropped non-sample
elderly families are also included here.

This individual moved out of the 1997 main family and was
eligible to be followed, but the reason for nonresponse

is NA.

Note that these relationships are those to the 1997 Head for any individual whose 1999

sequence number (ER33502) is greater than 50, that is, has moved out of the FU. Thus, for

example, if the 1997 Head is no longer present at the time of the 1999 interview, his or

her relationship to Head is coded 10; the new 1999 Head also is coded 10. Therefore, to

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 1999

interview.

This variable contains values for 1999 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 1999 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED

but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade

completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of

all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

interview.

This individual was not eligible to be followed and
became main family nonresponse because the Head or Wife,

This individual was a sample member but has been adopted

by unrelated nonsample persons and therefore has become

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

This individual became a followable non-sample parent
(had baby) in this wave. Because the PSID predetermines
followability before entering the field each wave, he/she
was not followed. However, beginning in the 1999 wave,
he/she is eligible for recontact efforts in the next

wave.

ER33616  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       01"      NUM(2.0)
G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2001

interview.

This variable contains values for 2001 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2001 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

for Head and Wife/"Wife" in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED

but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade

completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re-asked of

all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985.

This individual was a sample member but has been adopted

by unrelated nonsample persons and therefore has become

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

This individual became a followable non-sample parent
(had baby) in this wave. Because the PSID predetermines
followability before entering the field each wave, he/she
was not followed. However, beginning in the 1999 wave,
he/she is eligible for recontact efforts in the next

wave.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no
name or identifying information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous

office error (does not include codes 1-54 above or codes

91-99 below)

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2003

interview.

This variable contains values for 2003 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2003 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

ER24148 (Head) and ER24149 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re
asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level ER24153 (Heads) and ER24154

This individual was not eligible to be followed, and the
Head or Wife, whichever is sample, was unable to
cooperate through disability.

This individual died between the 2001 and 2003

interviews; this individual died after becoming
nonresponse for some other reason before the 2001

interview.

This individual was not eligible to be followed and
became main family nonresponse because the Head or Wife,
whichever is sample, died.

This individual was a sample member but has been adopted

by unrelated nonsample persons and therefore has become

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

This individual became a followable non-sample parent
(had baby) in this wave. Because the PSID predetermines
followability before entering the field each wave, he/she
was not followed. However, beginning in the 2001 wave,
he/she is eligible for recontact efforts in the next

wave.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no
name or identifying information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

Limited number of contacts attempted; miscellaneous

office error (does not include codes 1-54 above or codes

91-99 below)

This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer
followable and became nonresponse because either the
child is now aged 25 or is nonresponse and was not

selected for recontact in the next wave.

This individual was not eligible to be followed and was
associated with a family containing a person erroneously
designated as followable; the erroneous person's code is

45, 51, 53, 54, or 60.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2005

interview.

This variable contains values for 2005 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2005 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

ER28047 (Head) and ER28048 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re
asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level ER28052 (Heads) and ER28053

(Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this information.

This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse
because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, was unable
to cooperate because of disability.

This individual died between the 2003 and 2005

interviews; this individual died after becoming
nonresponse for some other reason before the 2003

interview.

This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse
because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

This individual was a sample member but has been adopted

by unrelated nonsample persons and therefore has become

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no
name or identifying information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

Limited number of contacts attempted: miscellaneous

office error (does not include codes 01-54 above or codes

91-99 below).

This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer
eligible to be interviewed.

This nonsample individual was associated with a family
containing a person erroneously designated as followable;
the erroneous person's code is 45, 51, 53, 54, or 60.

Individual connected with the Latino sample
(ER30001=7001-9308); this sample was dropped beginning in
1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample
due to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped
beginning in 1997.

This individual moved out of the 2005 main family and was
eligible to be followed, but the reason for nonresponse

is NA.

Individual moved out of the 2005 main family and was not
eligible to be followed.

All sample members of this FU united with other panel
FUs; this individual was nonsample and therefore became

nonresponse.

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2007

interview.

This variable contains values for 2007 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2007 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

ER41037 (Head) and ER41038 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re
asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See family-level ER41042 (Heads) and ER41043

(Wives/"Wives") for the recency of this information.

G90. What is the highest grade or year of school that (he/she) has completed?

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2009

interview.

This variable contains values for 2009 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2009 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

ER46981 (Head) and ER46982 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Education was re
asked of all Heads and Wives/"Wives" in 2009.

sequence number of the helpers are located on the Respondent record. For those Respondents

that had helpers, the sections of the questionnaire in which each helper assisted may be

found on the PSID 2011 Family File at ER52106-ER52159.

ER34119  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       11"      NUM(2.0)

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2011

interview.

This variable contains values for 2011 Heads and Wives/"Wives" from 2011 family-level

data, although information about completed education is not asked annually for them as it

is for other family unit members. This variable differs from the family-level variables

ER52405 (Head) and ER52406 (Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12.

This individual died between the 2009 and 2011

interviews; this individual died after becoming
nonresponse for some other reason before the 2009

interview.

This nonsample individual became main family nonresponse
because the Head or Wife, whichever is sample, died.

This individual was a sample member but has been adopted

by unrelated nonsample persons and therefore has become

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no
name or identifying information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

Limited number of contacts attempted: miscellaneous

office error (does not include codes 01-54 above or codes

91-99 below).

This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer
eligible to be interviewed.

This nonsample individual was associated with a family
containing a person erroneously designated as followable;
the erroneous person's code is 45, 51, 53, 54, or 60.

Individual connected with the Latino sample
(ER30001=7001-9308); this sample was dropped beginning in
1996. Individual dropped from the Census (SEO) sample
due to budgetary constraints; this group was dropped
beginning in 1997.

This individual moved out of the 2011 main family and was
eligible to be followed, but the reason for nonresponse

is NA.

Individual moved out of the 2011 main family and was not
eligible to be followed.

All sample members of this FU united with other panel
FUs; this individual was nonsample and therefore became

nonresponse.

This individual had not been born or moved in by the time

of the 2011 interview (ER34101>0 and ER34102=0);

individual from Immigrant 17 sample (ER30001=4001-4851)

This individual became main family or mover-out
nonresponse by 2009 and was not selected for recontact in

2011 (ER34001=0 and ER34101=0 and ER34148=0 or ER34001>0

IO28. Did anyone other than the Respondent answer any of the interview questions?

IO28A. Who was that? -- FIRST HELPER

During the post-interview phase, we ask questions of the interviewer about the interview

experience. For this series, IO28, we ask the interviewer if the Respondent had help

answering any of the interview questions. We follow up asking who helped him/her. The

sequence number of the helpers are located on the Respondent record. For those Respondents

who had helpers, the sections of the questionnaire in which each helper assisted may be

found on the PSID 2013 Family File: ER57910-ER57963.

        Panel Study of Income Dynamics: 1968-2023 Individual Data File

ER34230  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       13"      NUM(2.0)
What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Heads/Wives/"Wives" and OFUMs aged 16 years or older who

were in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2013

interview.

The values for 2013 Heads/Wives/"Wives" are pulled from 2013 family-level data. Beginning
in 2013, we asked for an education update from our returning Heads/Wives/"Wives". If they

report additional education attainment, then we have updated their education variables in

the background section and reported the year of the education update on the Family file
(see variables "Year Highest Education Updated", ER57557, for Wives/"Wives", and ER57667,

for Heads).

The values for 2013 OFUMs are derived from G90a1 (ER34219).

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER58223 (Head) and ER58224

(Wife/"Wife") in the treatment of Heads and Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not

attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for this

individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for OFUMs, this variable differs

from G90a1 (ER34219) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a GED (G90a2=2) but the value

derived from G90a1 is less than 12 years; that is, G90a1 retains the grade completed but

the value for this variable is coded as 12.

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no
name or identifying information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

As of the 2015 Wave, the education series for Head/Spouse/Partner and OFUMs (aged 16 or

older and in the FU last year) are parallel. Thus, we have included these education

variables as part of the Individual File although most are also repeated for
Heads/Spouses/Partners on the 2015 Family File in the KL background section, as well.

For new Heads/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the baseline education series is asked
(KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m). For returning Heads/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the

education update series (KL84a/G88dd) is asked. If the calculated level of completed

education in the update series is higher than previously reported, this variable indicates

the year this individual's main education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m) was updated.

Please note that the baseline education series for eligible OFUMs was first collected in

2013.

        Panel Study of Income Dynamics: 1968-2023 Individual Data File

ER34349  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       15"      NUM(2.0)
What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Heads/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16 years or older

who were in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2015

interview.

The values for 2015 Heads/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2015 family-level data.

Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning

Heads/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment was reported, we updated

their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the education

update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated", ER64680, for

Spouses/Partners, and ER64819, for Heads).

The values for 2015 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Heads/Spouses/Partners/eligible

OFUMS: uses variables that correspond to the main education series (KL43/G88a KL61b/G88m); for returning Heads/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that

correspond to the updated education series (KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are

parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER65459 (Head) and ER65460

(Spouse/Partner) in the treatment of Heads and Spouses/Partners who received a GED but did

not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the grade completed; for

this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for OFUMs, this variable

differs from G88c1 (ER34323) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a GED (G88b1=2) but

the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1 retains the grade

completed but the value for this variable is coded as 12.

As of the 2017 Wave, the education series for Reference Person/Spouse/Partner and OFUMs

education variables as part of the Individual File although most are also repeated for
Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners on the 2017 Family File in the KL background section,

as well.

For new Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the baseline education
series is asked (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m). For returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the education update series (KL84a/G88dd) is

asked. If the calculated level of completed education in the update series is higher than

previously reported, this variable indicates the year this individual's main education

Please note that the baseline education series for eligible OFUMs was first collected in

ER34548  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       17"      NUM(2.0)
What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16

years or older who were in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2017

interview.

The values for 2017 Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2017 family-level

data. Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning

Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment was reported, we

updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the

education update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated",

ER70753, for Spouses/Partners, and ER70891, for Reference Persons).

The values for 2017 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Reference

Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS: uses variables that correspond to the main
education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m); for returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that correspond to the updated
education series (KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER71538 (Reference Person) and

ER71539 (Spouse/Partner) in the treatment of Reference Persons and Spouses/Partners who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for

OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER34522) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a

GED (G88b1=2) but the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1

retains the grade completed but the value for this variable is coded as 12.

For the 2017 Wave, code 9 and code 10 were retro-coded. That is, these codes were not

available during the interview. As part of data processing, post-interviewing, codes 9

and 10 were coded from 97, "Other Health Insurance", where applicable.

Also, data users should note that during data processing we combined codes 6, 7, and 11 in

the original data collection instrument into code 12, a new code that combines: Military

Health Care/Tricare (Active duty)--code 6; Tricare/Champus/ChampVA (dependents, veterans)
-code 7; and Veterans Administration (VA)--code 11.

ER34717  "YEAR HIGHEST EDUCATION UPDATED    19"      NUM(4.0)
Year Reference Person/Spouse/Partner or OFUM education updated

As of the 2015 Wave, the education series for Reference Person/Spouse/Partner and OFUMs

(aged 16 or older and in the FU last year) are parallel. Thus, we have included these

education variables as part of the Individual File although most are also repeated for
Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners on the 2019 Family File in the KL background section,

as well.

For new Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the baseline education
series is asked (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m). For returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the education update series (KL84a/G88dd) is

asked. If the calculated level of completed education in the update series is higher than

previously reported, this variable indicates the year this individual's main education

series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m) was updated.

Please note that the baseline education series for eligible OFUMs was first collected in

2013.

ER34752  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       19"      NUM(2.0)
What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16

years or older who were in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2019

interview.

The values for 2019 Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2019 family-level

data. Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning

Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment was reported, we

updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the

education update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated",

ER76761, for Spouses/Partners, and ER76906, for Reference Persons).

The values for 2019 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Reference

Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS: uses variables that correspond to the main
education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m); for returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that correspond to the updated
education series (KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER77599 (Reference Person) and

ER77600 (Spouse/Partner) in the treatment of Reference Persons and Spouses/Partners who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for

OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER34722) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a

GED (G88b1=2) but the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1

retains the grade completed but the value for this variable is coded as 12.

Regular school includes high school and schooling that leads to a college or professional

The following series (ER34753-ER34787) is the educational update series for Reference

As of the 2015 Wave, the education series for Reference Person/Spouse/Partner and OFUMs

education variables as part of the Individual File although most are also repeated for
Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners on the 2021 Family File in the KL background section,

as well.

For new Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the baseline education
series is asked (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m). For returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the education update series (KL84a/G88dd) is

asked. If the calculated level of completed education in the update series is higher than

previously reported, this variable indicates the year this individual's main education

series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m) was updated.

Please note that the baseline education series for eligible OFUMs was first collected in

ER34952  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       21"      NUM(2.0)
What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16

years or older who were in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2021

interview.

The values for 2021 Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2021 family-level

data. Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning

Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment was reported, we

updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the

education update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated",

ER81026, for Spouses/Partners, and ER81153, for Reference Persons).

The values for 2021 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Reference

Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS: uses variables that correspond to the main
education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m); for returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that correspond to the updated
education series (KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER81935 (Reference Person) and

ER81936(Spouse/Partner) in the treatment of Reference Persons and Spouses/Partners who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for

OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER34922) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a

GED (G88b1=2) but the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1

retains the grade completed but the value for this variable is coded as 12.

(Have you/has [he/she]) attended regular school since our last interview on (PYIWDATE)?
Regular school includes high school and schooling that leads to a college or professional

school degree.

The following series (ER34953-ER34987) is the educational update series for Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMS. If the calculated educational level derived

from the update series is higher than previously reported, we have updated the main

educational series (ER34918-ER34952) with this new information. Variable ER34917 indicates

the year this series was updated for returning Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and

eligible OFUMs.

nonsample.

This individual, although followed for interview, was
discovered to be nonsample: office error.

This individual should have been followed but was not:

office error.

This individual was mistakenly included in two or more
response families at once; this record is the duplicate,

or erroneous, one.

Listing error: this individual never existed or was not
really living in the FU.

Insufficient information that would permit recontact; no
name or identifying information available

Due to budgetary and/or time constraints, PSID staff
decided not to take all of the usual steps to try to
locate and/or persuade this FU.

office error (does not include codes 01-54 above or codes

91-99 below).

This nonsample parent of a sample child is no longer
eligible to be interviewed.

Year Reference Person/Spouse/Partner or OFUM education updated

As of the 2015 Wave, the education series for Reference Person/Spouse/Partner and OFUMs

(aged 16 or older and in the FU last year) are parallel. Thus, we have included these

education variables as part of the Individual File although most are also repeated for
Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners on the 2023 Family File in the KL background section,

as well.

For new Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the baseline education
series is asked (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m). For returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners and eligible OFUMs, the education update series (KL84a/G88dd) is

asked. If the calculated level of completed education in the update series is higher than

previously reported, this variable indicates the year this individual's main education

series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m) was updated.

Please note that the baseline education series for eligible OFUMs was first collected in

2013.

ER35152  "YEARS COMPLETED EDUCATION       23"      NUM(2.0)
What is the highest grade or year of school that (you/he/she) has completed?

This variable contains values for Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners and OFUMs aged 16

years or older who were in the Family Unit in the prior year.

The values for this variable represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value

of 08 indicates that this individual completed the eighth grade by the time of the 2023

interview.

The values for 2023 Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners are pulled from 2023 family-level

data. Beginning in the 2013 Wave, we asked for an education update for our returning

Reference Persons/Spouses/Partners. If additional educational attainment was reported, we

updated their education variables in the background section and reported the year of the

education update on the Family file (see variables "Year Highest Education Updated",

ER81026, for Spouses/Partners, and ER81153, for Reference Persons).

The values for 2023 OFUMs are derived as follows: for new Reference

Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMS: uses variables that correspond to the main
education series (KL43/G88a - KL61b/G88m); for returning Reference
Persons/Spouses/Partners/eligible OFUMs: uses variables that correspond to the updated
education series (KL74/G88n - KL83b/G88bb). These data are parallel as of the 2015 Wave.

This variable differs from the family-level variables ER81935 (Reference Person) and

ER81936(Spouse/Partner) in the treatment of Reference Persons and Spouses/Partners who

received a GED but did not attend college. The value for the family-level variable is the

grade completed; for this individual-level variable, the value is 12. Similarly, for

OFUMs, this variable differs from G88c1 (ER35122) in the treatment of OFUMs who received a

GED (G88b1=2) but the value derived from G88c1 is less than 12 years; that is, G88c1

retains the grade completed but the value for this variable is coded as 12.
