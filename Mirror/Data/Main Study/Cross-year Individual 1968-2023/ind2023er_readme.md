**I. DATA CHARACTERISTICS**

A. Files and Format

The 1968-2023 Individual data consists of one data file with 85,536 records and 2,771 variables. The data
are merged across all waves of the study; that is, they include person information collected from 1968 through
2023. Each person ever in an interviewed family, even for just one wave, has his or her own data record.
Consequently, the file contains records for both 2023 response and 2023 non-response individuals.

Using the web-based Data Center is the most efficient way to obtain the data. At this time, we also provide
the data in a .zip package. If you download the data in ASCII form from the PSID website, you will receive
SAS, SPSS or STATA statements, as you request. In the .zip package, we include the entire data file in ASCII
format and SAS, SPSS and STATA data definition statements. These statements provide variable names,
locations, and variable labels.

The definition statement files are not intended to represent complete and full programs for the respective
statistical program packages to run extracts, analysis, etc. You must provide all other statements needed to
complete a program. Missing data statements are not provided as part of the files.

B. Variable Names and Positions

The 1968-2023 Individual data file consists of yearly items (e.g., Sequence Number, Relationship to
Reference Person, Family Identification Number) and a set of summary or cross-year variables with up-todate values (ER32001-ER32054, Sex of Individual, ER32000).

Weights for each wave of data are available through 2023 and are located at or near the end of each year's
list of variables.

The order of variables is as follows:

- RELEASE NUMBER, ER30000,

- 1968 through 1993 Individual data arranged, as usual, by wave, ER30001-ER30866

- the summary variables, ER31990-ER31997 and ER32001-ER32054,

- the 1994 Public Release Individual data, ER33101-ER33150,

- the 1995 Public Release Individual data, ER33201-ER33299B,

- the 1996 Public Release Individual data, ER33301-ER33347,

- the 1997 Public Release Individual data, ER33401-ER33438,

- the 1999 Public Release Individual data, ER33501-ER33547,

- the 2001 Public Release Individual data, ER33601-ER33639,

- the 2003 Public Release Individual data, ER33701-ER33742,

- the 2005 Public Release Individual data, ER33801-ER33849,

- the 2007 Public Release Individual data, ER33901-ER33951,

- the 2009 Public Release Individual data, ER34001-ER34046,

- the 2011 Public Release Individual data, ER34101-ER34155,

- the 2013 Public Release Individual data, ER34201-ER34269,

- the 2015 Public Release Individual data, ER34301-ER34414,

- the 2017 Public Release Individual data, ER34501-ER34651,

- the 2019 Public Release Individual data, ER34701-ER34864,

C. Documentation and Codes

1. PSID User Guide

For an overview of the 2023 questionnaire changes, a description of our generated and hand coded variables,
please see the PSID Main Interview User Manual: located on our website at
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/documents.aspx.](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/documents.aspx)

2. 2023 Questionnaire

Box-and-arrow questionnaires are available for all waves in PDF format. Use the SAS, SPSS and STATA
data definition statements to match variables with questions in the CAI application.

3. Codebook and Code Categories

The Data Center allows users to create and download customized codebooks that provide variable-specific
documentation; variable descriptions are complete for all of the 2023 family data items. The downloadable
.zip package of the family data on our website contains a .pdf version of the entire individual codebook for
1968-2023.

In general, codes follow our traditional schema, although "don't know" responses are now largely
distinguished from other missing data responses. Generally, code 8 (or 98 or 998, etc.) represents "don't
know" and code 9 (or 99 or 999, etc.) represents other missing data or a refusal. Inappropriate questions are
padded with zeroes.

If a variable contains a code value that is neither included in the codebook nor one of the "zero", "eight" or
"nine" codes just mentioned, assume missing data for that value.

D. Missing Data

Users should note that CDS-2023 variables selection result and completeness variables (ER35259, ER35260
and ER35261) are filled with zeros for Release 1. Final data col reconciliation for this study was not finalized
at the time of this release.
