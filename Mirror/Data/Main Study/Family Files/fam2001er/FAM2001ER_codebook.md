ER17001  "RELEASE NUMBER"                   NUM(1.0)

Release Number

May 2008: Variables ER20395-ER20458, formerly available separately, have now been

incorporated into this file with those variable names. Variable ER20394 has been

recalculated. Variable ER20459, a family cross-sectional weight, has been added.

November 2013: Added generated variables Births to HD/WF/OFUM (ER20458A-ER20458H), Region

HD Grew Up (ER20377A), Head Geographic Mobility (ER20377B), K-6 Distress Scale (ER19833A).

Also added Calls for Iw (ER17005B), and Iw Length (ER17005C). For this release we have

also updated some of the KL background variables that were not ready at the time of the

original 2001 release. On release 3, we are suppressing some additional variables to

protect the anonymity of our respondents.

February 2014: For Release 4 we have added one new coded variable in the philanthropy

section (ER20081A) and Collapsed Beale (ER20377C). Additionally, we have corrected extant

T-2 variables for a handful of cases.

January 2016: For Release 5 we have corrected the bottom code for H14/H38

(ER19709/ER19817) and H17/H41 (ER19712/ER19820) for both Head and Wife/"Wife" where 1

means one cigarette or fewer per day.

November 2017: For Release 6 we have added 25 generated food security variables (ER18470A
ER18470Y). The food security variables were put through the same imputation and

calculation process as was completed on the 2015 data to produce food security scale score

and category. We have also added the aggregated consumption variables (ER20456A1
ER20456D6) to the family release file. These variables were previously released on a

supplemental file.

June 2023: For Release 7, we have added 26 variables to the consumption series. 25

variables are accuracy codes and one is a generated variable TOTAL EXPENDITURE 2001

(ER20456D7). Users should also note that the range for HOME INSURANCE EXPENDITURE

(ER20456A9) was revised.

or your family have any real estate other than your main home, such as a second home,

land, rental real estate, or money owed to you on a land contract?

T1. In this next to the last section, we will be talking about donations of time and money
to charitable organizations.

Charitable organizations include religious or non-profit organizations that help those in
need or that serve and support the public interests. They range in size from national
organizations like the United Way and the American Red Cross down to local community
organizations. They serve a variety of purposes such as religious activity, helping people

in need, health care and medical research, education, arts, environment, and international

aid. Our definition of charity does not include political contributions.

Donations include any gifts of money, assets, or property made directly to the
organization, through payroll deduction, or collected by other means on behalf of the
charity. This interview is limited to donations made during the calendar year 2000.

During the year 2000, did you or anyone in your family donate money, assets, or property
with a combined value of more than $25 to religious or charitable organizations?

mean spending time doing unpaid work and not just belonging to an organization.

Volunteers are involved in many activities such as coaching, helping at school, serving on
committees, building and repairing, providing health care or emotional support, delivering
food, doing office work, organizing activities, fundraising, and other kinds of work done

for no pay.

R67. INTERVIEWER CHECKPOINT

The poverty level is defined based on 1999 income (ER20165) and number in the 1999 FU, as

follows:

NUMBER IN 1999 FU    1999 TOTAL FAMILY INCOME

1            $16,700 or less

2            $22,500 or less

3            $28,300 or less

4            $34,100 or less

5            $39,900 or less

6            $45,700 or less

7            $51,500 or less

8            $57,300 or less

If the number in 1999 FU is greater than 8, then increments of $5800 are added to the base

of $57,300 for each additional person.

Information about receipt of public assistance was taken from Question R47 (ER20167). See

that variable for details.

Annual Needs Standard for the 2000 Family--USDA Version

This is the Orshansky-type poverty threshold based on an annual food needs standard which

is derived from weekly food costs. The weekly food costs are taken from USDA Low-Cost

Plan estimates as published in the Family Economics Review, June 1967, and adjusted to

take account of changes in family composition during 2000. It is converted to an annual

amount and further adjusted for economies of scale by USDA rules as follows:

Single person . . . . . . . . . . . .add 20%

Two persons . . . . . . . . . . . . .add 10%

Three persons . . . . . . . . . . . . add 5%

Four persons . . . . . . . . . . .no change

Five persons . . . . . . . . . . .deduct 5%

Six or more persons . . . . . . . deduct 10%

An additional adjustment for diseconomies of small households (in

rent, etc.) was made as follows:

4.89 times the food needs for single persons

3.70 times the food needs for two-person units

3.00 times the food needs for all other units

The table for weekly food costs is located in the Wave XXV (1992) documentation at the

description for V21487. This table is in 1967 dollars.

Please refer to the Wave VII (1974) Documentation volume, pp. 39-41, and to the User Guide

for further details on the needs standard.

Note that this variable is not adjusted for inflation, nor is it exactly comparable to the

official poverty standard; such changes are left to users. This needs standard is

This variable is suppressed (filled with zeroes) in the public release file to protect the

anonymity of respondents. The data are available in a separate file: FAM19YEAR_rst where

Year is the corresponding Family File year (i.e. FAM1968_rst contains data for suppressed

variables from the 1968 file). This file is available to qualified users under special

contractual arrangements with the PSID. For more information, contact us at

PSIDhelp@umich.edu and request PSIDCountyIdentifiers restricted file.

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes. However, code values

have been increased by one. That is, code 01 here is equivalent to code 0 as originally

used by Beale and Ross. Metropolitan status is that announced by the Office of Management

and Budget in June 1983, when the current population criteria were first applied to

results of the 1980 Census. Adjacency was determined by both physical boundary adjacency

and a finding that at least 2 percent of the employed labor force in the nonmetropolitan

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes. However, code values

have been increased by one; that is, code 1 here is equivalent to code 0 as originally

used by Beale and Ross. In addition for this variable, we have collapsed original codes 9

and 10 into one category to maintain the anonymity of our respondents.

Metropolitan status is that announced by the Office of Management and Budget in June 1983,

when the current population criteria were first applied to results of the 1980 Census.

Adjacency was determined by both physical boundary adjacency and a finding that at least 2

percent of the employed labor force in the nonmetropolitan county commuted to metropolitan

central counties.

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of

the Head completed at least some postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has

remained the same person from the previous interview (ER19951=5), this variable has been

carried forward from previous years' data with no updating or other change. Education was

reasked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33616 in the treatment of Heads

who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such

WIFE/"WIFE", Husband of Head, or First-Year Cohabitor

NOTE: The information in ER20458A - ER20458H is based on data gathered in birth history

questions interspersed throughout Section J of the 2001 questionnaire. The birth data were

asked for:

a) each male Head, unless all of the following were true: he was also Head in 2000, had

the same legal Wife in both waves (ER20371=1 and ER20370=1 and ER17007=0-1), and she was

age 45 or older at the time of the 2001 interview.

b) each female Head, unless both of the following were true: she was Head, Wife, or "Wife"

in 2000 and was age 45 or older at the time of the 2001 interview.

c) each Wife or "Wife", unless both of the following were true: she was Head, Wife, or

"Wife" in 2000 and was age 45 or older at the time of the 2001 interview.

d) all other family unit members, including husbands of Head (ER33603=90) and first-year

cohabitors (ER33603=88), who were age 12 through 44 at the time of the 2001 interview.

e) all recontact Heads and Wives/"Wives".

The values for this variable indicate the number of children born between January 1, 2000,

and December 31, 2000, to the Head but not jointly with the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head,

or first-year cohabitor (ER33603=20, 22, 90 or 88, respectively), if one is present in the

FU. The data are based only on information reported in the 2001 wave. Because of age and

relationship variations in what was asked, this information is not known in some cases.

See the note above for a description of the restrictions. If birth questions were asked

about the Head but not the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head, or first-year cohabitor, then

births to Head were counted in this variable.

Number of Children Born During Calendar Year 1999 to Head But Not Jointly with
WIFE/"WIFE", Husband of Head, or First-Year Cohabitor

The values for this variable indicate the number of children born between January 1, 1999,

and December 31, 1999, to the Head but not jointly with the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head,

or first-year cohabitor (ER33603=20, 22, 90 or 88, respectively), if one is present in the

FU. The data are based only on information reported in the 2001 wave. Because of age and

See the note at  ER20458A for a description of the restrictions. If birth questions were

asked about the Head but not the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head, or first-year cohabitor,

then births to Head were counted in this variable.
