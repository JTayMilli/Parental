ER36001  "RELEASE NUMBER"                   NUM(1.0)

Release Number

January 2012: For Release 3, we have reconfigured variable ER36106 A50 Why did you move? We have recoded cases originally coded as 'Other/ambiguous' into

existing categories where possible.

December 2013: Correcting the following variable; Births to OFUMS only - 2005 (ER41067)

and P20b Whether amount 10,000 (ER37762) In addition, we are suppressing two previously

publicly released variables Beale Rural-Urban Code (ER41033) and Size of Largest City in

County (ER41034).

February 2014: In Release 5, we have added one new coded variable in the philanthropy

section M12code (ER40681A) and Collapsed Beale (ER41033A). Additionally, we have corrected

extant T-2 variables for a handful of cases.

January 2016: For Release 6 we have added 96 new variables in the T-2 (2005) Income

section, 86 of which are about time unemployed for Head (ER40686A1-ER40686B5) and

Wife/"Wife" (ER40686F4-ER40686G8), time out of the labor force for Head (ER40686B6
ER40686D1) and Wife/"Wife" (ER40686G9-ER40686J4), and time employed for Head (ER40686D2
ER40686E7) and Wife/"Wife" (ER40686J5-ER40686L1). The other 10 new variables are T-2 hours

worked, labor income, and accuracy checks for Head (ER40686E8-ER40686F3) and for

Wife/"Wife" (ER40686L2- ER40686L6).

November 2017: For Release 7 we have added the aggregated consumption variables

(ER41027A1-ER41027E3). These variables were previously released on a supplemental file. A

correction was made to the imputation of missing data for vehicle gasoline costs,

additional vehicle costs, and vehicle repair costs.

June 2023: For Release 8, we have added 34 variables. 31 variables are accuracy codes and

one is a generated variable TOTAL EXPENDITURE (ER41027E4) for consumption. 2 variables

were added to chronic conditions. Users should also note that the range for HOME INSURANCE

EXPENDITURE 2007 (ER41027A9) was revised.

ER40620  "M1 WTR DONATION>25 TO CHARITY LAST YEAR"       NUM(1.0)

M1. In this next to the last section, we will be talking about donations of time and money
to charitable organizations.

Charitable organizations include religious or non-profit organizations that help those in
need or that serve and support the public interest. They range in size from national
organizations like the United Way and the American Red Cross down to local community
organizations. They serve a variety of purposes such as religious activity, helping
people in need, health care and medical research, education, arts, environment, and
international aid. Our definition of charity does not include political contributions.

Donations include any gifts of money, assets, or property/goods made directly to the
organization, through payroll deduction, or collected by other means on behalf of the
charity. This interview is limited to donations made during the calendar year 2006, with
one exception. We will be asking you separately about all donations that you made to help

victims of last December's tsunami later in this section.

During the year 2006, did (you/you or anyone in your family) donate money, assets, or
property/goods with a combined value of more than $25 to religious or charitable
organizations?

Annual Needs Standard for the 2006 Family--USDA Version

This is the Orshansky-type poverty threshold based on an annual food needs standard which

is derived from weekly food costs. The weekly food costs are taken from USDA Low-Cost

Plan estimates as published in the Family Economics Review, June 1967, and adjusted to

take account of changes in family composition during 2006. It is converted to an annual

amount and further adjusted for economies of scale by USDA rules as follows:

Single person . . . . . . . . . . . .add 20%

Two persons . . . . . . . . . . . . .add 10%

Three persons . . . . . . . . . . . . add 5%

Four persons . . . . . . . . . . .no change

Five persons . . . . . . . . . . .deduct 5%

Six or more persons . . . . . . . deduct 10%

An additional adjustment for diseconomies of small households (in

rent, etc.) was made as follows:

4.89 times the food needs for single persons

3.70 times the food needs for two-person units

3.00 times the food needs for all other units

The table for weekly food costs is located in the Wave XXV (1992) documentation at the

description for V21487. The table is in 1967 dollars.

Please refer to the Wave VII (1974) Documentation volume, pp. 39-41, and to the User Guide

for further details on the needs standard.

Note that this variable is not adjusted for inflation, nor is it exactly comparable to the

official poverty standard; such changes are left to users. This needs standard is

adjusted for changes in family composition during 2006 and is not adjusted for farmers.

Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of

8 indicates that the Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that

the Head completed at least some postgraduate work. Values were computed as follows: If

it is not known whether Head attended college (ER40585=8 or 9) or the number of years of

college is unknown (ER40588=8 or 9), then the value is 99. Otherwise, if Head attended

college (ER40585=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years of college attended

(ER40588). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER40585=5), the values are as

follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER40574=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER40574=2), the value is the last grade finished

(ER40577);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER40574=3), the value is the

last grade finished (ER40582);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or

neither (ER40574=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has

remained the same person from the previous interview (ER40527=5), this variable has been

carried forward from previous years' data with no updating or other change. Education was

reasked of all Heads in 1985. See ER41042 for the recency of this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33917 in the treatment of Heads

who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such

Heads is the grade completed; for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with no updating or other
change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See ER41043 for the recency of

this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33917 in the treatment of

Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable
value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed; for the individual-level variable,

the value is 12.

Year in Which 2007 Head Most Recently Became New Head

This variable contains the year of data collection in which background information in

ER40527-ER40619 was most recently gathered for the 2007 Head. If a Head splits off from

the main family, e.g., through divorce, background information is reasked. Some of this

information can change over time; thus, this variable can be used by the analyst to

indicate which waves of data might be searched to update the variables concerned. However,

in the 1985 and 1997 waves, most background information was reasked. The 2007 variables

that are equivalent to background variables asked of all heads in 1985 are ER40548
ER40559, ER40563-ER40566, ER40572, ER40574-ER40592, ER40595-ER40612 and ER40614-ER40615;

the 2007 variables that are equivalent to background variables asked of all heads in 1997

are ER40528-ER40534, ER40538-ER40544, ER40565-ER40568, and ER40593. All immigrant sample

Heads were asked this information in 1997 (or 1999, for the immigrant sample addition).

ER41059  "HOUSEHOLD ID #"                   NUM(5.0)

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units

residing in the same households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2007 ID

number (ER36002) with the lowest value from among the 2007 ID numbers (ER36002) of those

families comprising each such household group. This value was used in these file positions

for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this

variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other.

Family units who did not share their households with any other family unit or shared only

with non-panel family units were given their own values for ER36002. The range of values

is 1-8041, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking Data: Families Sharing

Households' in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1993 family data, 93GUIDE.PDF, for a

discussion of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Number of Children Born During Calendar Year 2006 to Head But Not Jointly with
Wife/"Wife", Husband of Head, or First-Year Cohabitor

NOTE: The information in ER41060-ER41067 is based on data gathered in birth history

questions interspersed throughout Section J of the 2007 questionnaire. The birth data were

asked for:

a) each male Head, unless all of the following were true: he was also Head in 2006, had

the same legal Wife in both waves (ER41041=1 and ER41040=1 and ER36007=0-1), and she was

age 45 or older at the time of the 2007 interview.

b) each female Head, unless both of the following were true: she was Head, Wife, or "Wife"

in 2006 and was age 45 or older at the time of the 2007 interview.

c) each Wife or "Wife", unless both of the following were true: she was Head, Wife, or

"Wife" in 2006 and was age 45 or older at the time of the 2007 interview.

d) all other family unit members, including husbands of Head (ER33903=90) and first-year

cohabitors (ER33903=88), who were age 12 through 44 at the time of the 2007 interview.

e) all recontact Heads and Wives/"Wives".

The values for this variable indicate the number of children born between January 1, 2006,

and December 31, 2006, to the Head but not jointly with the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head,

or first-year cohabitor (ER33903=20, 22, 90 or 88, respectively), if one is present in the

FU. The data are based only on information reported in the 2007 wave. Because of age and

relationship variations in what was asked, this information is not known in some cases.

See the note above for a description of the restrictions. If birth questions were asked

about the Head but not the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head, or first-year cohabitor, then

births to Head were counted in this variable.
