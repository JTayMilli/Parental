Release Number

May 2008: Variable ER23268 has been reconstructed; variable ER24179 has been

recalculated. Variable ER24180, a family cross-sectional weight, has been added.

November 2013: Correcting Births to OFUMS in 2001 (ER24178) and suppressing previously

released variables Beale Rural-Urban Code (ER24144), and Size of Largest City the county

(ER24145).

February 2014: For Release 6 we have added four new coded variables in the philanthropy

section M12code, M41code, M43code and M52code (ER23542A, ER23664A, ER23674A, ER23697A).

Additionally we have added fourteen new T-2 (Section R) variables (ER23718A-ER23718N) and

Collapsed Beale (ER24144A).

January 2016: For Release 7 we have added 96 new variables in the T-2 (2001) Income

section, 86 of which are about time unemployed for Head (ER23702A1-ER23702B5) and

Wife/"Wife" (ER23702F4-ER23702G8), time out of the labor force for Head (ER23702B6
ER23702D1) and Wife/"Wife" (ER23702G9-ER23702J4), and time employed for Head (ER23702D2
ER23702E7) and Wife/"Wife" (ER23702J5-ER23702L1). The other 10 new variables are T-2 hours

worked, labor income, and accuracy checks for Head (ER23702E8-ER23702F3) and for

Wife/"Wife" (ER23702L2-ER23702L6).

November 2017: For release 8, we have added 25 generated food security variables

(ER21735A-ER23735Y). The food security variables were put through the same imputation and

calculation process as was completed on the 2015 data to produce food security scale score

and category. We also added the aggregated consumption variables (ER24138A1-ER24138D6) to

the family release file. These variables were previously released on a supplemental file.

June 2023: For Release 9, we have added 26 variables to the consumption series. 25

variables are accuracy codes and one is a generated variable TOTAL EXPENDITURE

(ER24138D7). Users should also note that the range for HOME INSURANCE EXPENDITURE

(ER24138A9) was revised.

ER23268  "K-6 NON-SPEC PSYCHOL DISTRESS SCALE"         NUM(2.0)

The K-6 Non-Specific Psychological Distress Scale

This scale was developed by Dr. Ronald Kessler, Professor of Healthcare Policy at Harvard

Medical School. It includes six items, H59a-H59f (ER23262-ER23267), using a scale of 1-5,

which ranges from 'all of the time' to 'none of the time.' The items are rescored as

follows: A response of 'All of the Time' = 4 points, 'Most of the Time' = 3 points, 'Some

of the Time' = 2 points, 'A Little of the Time' = 1 point, and 'None of the Time' = 0

points. The scores are summed; a score of 13 or higher indicates sensitivity around the

threshold for the clinically significant range of the distribution of nonspecific

distress.

ER23481  "M1 WTR DONATION>25 TO CHARITY LAST YEAR"       NUM(1.0)

M1. In this next to the last section, we will be talking about donations of time and money
to charitable organizations.

Charitable organizations include religious or non-profit organizations that help those in
need or that serve and support the public interest. They range in size from national
organizations like the United Way and the American Red Cross down to local community
organizations. They serve a variety of purposes such as religious activity, helping
people in need, health care and medical research, education, arts, environment, and
international aid. Our definition of charity does not include political contributions.

Donations include any gifts of money, assets, or property/goods made directly to the
organization, through payroll deduction, or collected by other means on behalf of the
charity. This interview is limited to donations made during the calendar year 2002.

During the year 2002, did (you/you or anyone in your family) donate money, assets, or
property/goods with a combined value of more than $25 to religious or charitable
organizations?

ER23550  "M14 WTR HEAD VOLUNTEERED PAST MONTH"         NUM(1.0)

M14. Let's talk about volunteering through the kinds of organizations we've been
discussing. By "volunteering" we don't mean just belonging to an organization. We mean
doing unpaid work.

Some volunteering is ongoing, such as coaching, helping at school, serving on committees,
building and repairing, providing health care or emotional support, counseling, delivering
food, doing office work, and weekly church work. Other volunteering is occasional, like
neighborhood clean-ups, fund raising drives, and special activities during the holidays.

In the last month, did you do any volunteer activity through organizations?

This question (and the three following, ER23551-ER23553) were asked about the respondent.

In order to identify the individual to whom these questions refer, see ER24073. It

contains the relationship of the respondent to the Head of the FU. For example, if

ER24073=1, these questions refer to the Head.

did (you/she/he) do any of this kind of volunteer activity through organizations?--NON
VOLUNTEERING SPOUSE

This series of questions, M45-M52a (ER23684-ER23698), was asked only when one person of a

couple (either Head or Wife/"Wife") was coded as not having volunteered in 2002 at M14c

(ER23553). In order to identify the individual to whom these questions refer, see

ER24073. It contains the relationship of the respondent to the Head of the FU. Combine

this information with values from ER23553. Thus, for example, if ER24073 is coded 1

(Head) and ER23553 is coded 1 (Respondent only), then this sequence refers to the

Wife/"Wife".

ER24139  "USDA NEEDS STANDARD-PREVIOUS YR"           NUM(5.0)

Annual Needs Standard for the 2002 Family--USDA Version

This is the Orshansky-type poverty threshold based on an annual food needs standard which

is derived from weekly food costs. The weekly food costs are taken from USDA Low-Cost

Plan estimates as published in the Family Economics Review, June 1967, and adjusted to

take account of changes in family composition during 2002. It is converted to an annual

amount and further adjusted for economies of scale by USDA rules as follows:

Single person . . . . . . . . . . . .add 20%

Two persons . . . . . . . . . . . . .add 10%

Three persons . . . . . . . . . . . . add 5%

Four persons . . . . . . . . . . .no change

Five persons . . . . . . . . . . .deduct 5%

Six or more persons . . . . . . . deduct 10%

An additional adjustment for diseconomies of small households (in

rent, etc.) was made as follows:

4.89 times the food needs for single persons

3.70 times the food needs for two-person units

3.00 times the food needs for all other units

The table for weekly food costs is located in the Wave XXV (1992) documentation at the

description for V21487. The table is in 1967 dollars.

Please refer to the Wave VII (1974) Documentation volume, pp. 39-41, and to the User Guide

for further details on the needs standard.

Note that this variable is not adjusted for inflation, nor is it exactly comparable to the

official poverty standard; such changes are left to users. This needs standard is

adjusted for changes in family composition during 2002 and is not adjusted for farmers.

(ER23449). Otherwise, if Head did not attend college, (ER23446=5), the values are as

follows:

(a) if Head is a high school graduate (ER23435=1), the value is 12;

(b) if Head received a GED (ER23435=2), the value is the last grade finished

(ER23438);

(c) if Head neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER23435=3), the value is the

last grade finished (ER23443);

(d) if it is not known whether Head graduated from high school, got a GED, or

neither (ER23435=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has

remained the same person from the previous interview (ER23388=5), this variable has been

carried forward from previous years' data with no updating or other change. Education was

reasked of all Heads in 1985. See ER24153 for the recency of this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33716 in the treatment of Heads

who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such

Heads is the grade completed; for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER24149  "COMPLETED ED-WF"                   NUM(2.0)
2003 Wife's/"Wife's" Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of
8 indicates that the Wife/"Wife" completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates
that the Wife/"Wife" completed at least some postgraduate work. Values were computed as
follows: If it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" attended college (ER23354=8 or 9) or the

number of years of college is unknown (ER23357=8 or 9), then the value is 99. Otherwise,
if Wife/"Wife" attended college (ER23354=1), then the value is 12 plus the number of years
of college attended (ER23357). Otherwise, if Wife/"Wife" did not attend college,

(ER23354=5), the values are as follows:

(a) if Wife/"Wife" is a high school graduate (ER23343=1), the value is 12;
(b) if Wife/"Wife" received a GED (ER23343=2), the value is the last grade finished

(ER23346);

(c) if Wife/"Wife" neither graduated from high school nor got a GED (ER23343=3), the value

is the last grade finished (ER23351);
(d) if it is not known whether Wife/"Wife" graduated from high school, got a GED, or

neither (ER23343=8 or 9), then the value is 99.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Wife/"Wife". In cases where the

Wife/"Wife" has remained the same person from the previous interview (ER23303=5), this

variable has been carried forward from previous years' data with no updating or other
change. Education was asked of all Wives/"Wives" in 1985. See ER24154 for the recency of

this information.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33716 in the treatment of

Wives/"Wives" who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable
value for such Wives/"Wives" is the grade completed; for the individual-level variable,

the value is 12.

Year in Which 2003 Head Most Recently Became New Head

This variable contains the year of data collection in which background information in

ER23388-ER23480 was most recently gathered for the 2003 Head. If a Head splits off from

the main family, e.g., through divorce, background information is reasked. Some of this

information can change over time; thus, this variable can be used by the analyst to

indicate which waves of data might be searched to update the variables concerned. However,

in the 1985 and 1997 waves, most background information was reasked. The 2003 variables

that are equivalent to background variables asked of all heads in 1985 are ER23407
ER23418, ER23425-ER23427, ER23433, ER23435-ER23453, ER23455-ER23472 and ER23474-ER23475;

the 2003 variables that are equivalent to background variables asked of all heads in 1997

are ER23389-ER23395, ER23398-ER23404, ER23426-ER23429, and ER23454. All immigrant sample

Heads were asked this information in 1997 (or 1999, for the immigrant sample addition).

ER24170  "HOUSEHOLD ID #"                   NUM(5.0)

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units

residing in the same households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 2003 ID

number (ER21002) with the lowest value from among the 2003 ID numbers (ER21002) of those

families comprising each such household group. This value was used in these file positions

for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this

variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other.

Family units who did not share their households with any other family unit or shared only

with non-panel family units were given their own values for ER21002. The range of values

is 1-7870, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking Data: Families Sharing

Households' in Section I, Part 5 of the 1993 (Wave XXVI) documentation for a discussion of

ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.

Number of Children Born During Calendar Year 2002 to Head But Not Jointly with
Wife/"Wife", Husband of Head, or First-Year Cohabitor

NOTE: The information in ER24171-ER24178 is based on data gathered in birth history

questions interspersed throughout Section J of the 2003 questionnaire. The birth data were

asked for:

a) each male Head, unless all of the following were true: he was also Head in 2002, had

the same legal Wife in both waves (ER24152=1 and ER24151=1 and ER21007=0-1), and she was

age 45 or older at the time of the 2003 interview.

b) each female Head, unless both of the following were true: she was Head, Wife, or "Wife"

in 2002 and was age 45 or older at the time of the 2003 interview.

c) each Wife or "Wife", unless both of the following were true: she was Head, Wife, or

"Wife" in 2002 and was age 45 or older at the time of the 2003 interview.

d) all other family unit members, including husbands of Head (ER33703=90) and first-year

cohabitors (ER33703=88), who were age 12 through 44 at the time of the 2003 interview.

e) all recontact Heads and Wives/"Wives".

The values for this variable indicate the number of children born between January 1, 2002,

and December 31, 2002, to the Head but not jointly with the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head,

or first-year cohabitor (ER33703=20, 22, 90 or 88, respectively), if one is present in the

FU. The data are based only on information reported in the 2003 wave. Because of age and

relationship variations in what was asked, this information is not known in some cases.

See the note above for a description of the restrictions. If birth questions were asked

about the Head but not the Wife/"Wife", husband of Head, or first-year cohabitor, then

births to Head were counted in this variable.
