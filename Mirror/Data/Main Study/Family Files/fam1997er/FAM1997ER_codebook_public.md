incorporated into this file with those variable names. Variable ER12084 has been
recalculated. Variable ER12224, a family cross-sectional weight, has been added.

DUFU variables (ER12223F-ER12223R), Splitoff variables (ER12223D-ER12223E), Births to

ER12084  "FAMILY WEIGHT"                    NUM(7.3)
1997 Core/Immigrant Longitudinal Family Weight

This family weight was recalculated for Release 4.  It is used for analysis of all 1997
families, including the immigrant sample families that were added in 1997 as well as the
PSID core families.

For details on the construction of this weight, go to the PSID website,
psidonline.isr.umich.edu/: select 'Data & Documentation', then select 'Sample Weights',
then PSID Longitudinal Weights, and 'PSID Revised Longitudinal Weights 1993-2005'.

Note that some families have a zero family weight. Most of these families contained
nonsample parents of sample children (aged 18 or younger) who reside in another panel
family unit.

Annual Needs Standard for the 1996 Family--USDA Version

This is the Orshansky-type poverty threshold based on an annual food needs standard which
is derived from weekly food costs. The weekly food costs are taken from USDA Low-Cost
Plan estimates as published in the Family Economics Review, June 1967, and adjusted to
take account of changes in family composition during 1996. It is converted to an annual
amount and further adjusted for economies of scale by USDA rules as follows:

Single person . . . . . . . . . . . .add 20%

Two persons . . . . . . . . . . . . .add 10%

Three persons . . . . . . . . . . . . add 5%

Four persons . . . . . . . . . . .no change

Five persons . . . . . . . . . . .deduct 5%

Six or more persons . . . . . . . deduct 10%

An additional adjustment for diseconomies of small households (in
rent, etc.) was made as follows:

4.89 times the food needs for single persons

3.70 times the food needs for two-person units

3.00 times the food needs for all other units

The table for weekly food costs is located in the Wave XXV (1992) documentation at the
description for V21487. The table is in 1967 dollars.

Please refer to the Wave VII (1974) Documentation volume, pp. 39-41, and to the User Guide
for further details on the needs standard.

Note that this variable is not adjusted for inflation, nor is it exactly comparable to the
official poverty standard; such changes are left to users. This needs standard is
adjusted for changes in family composition during 1996 and is not adjusted for farmers.

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes. However, code values
have been increased by one; that is, code 1 here is equivalent to code 0 as originally
used by Beale and Ross. Metropolitan status is that announced by the Office of Management

results of the 1980 Census. Adjacency was determined by both physical boundary adjacency
and a finding that at least 2 percent of the employed labor force in the nonmetropolitan
county commuted to metropolitan central counties.

ER12221F  "RURAL-URBAN CODE (BEALE-COLLAPSED)"         NUM(2.0)
Beale-Ross Rural-Urban Continuum Code for 1997 Residence - Collapsed Version

These codes are based on matches to the FIPS state and county codes. However, code values
have been increased by one; that is, code 1 here is equivalent to code 0 as originally
used by Beale and Ross. In addition for this variable, we have collapsed originial codes
9 and 10 into one category to maintain the anonymity of our respondents.

Metropolitan status is that announced by the Office of Management and Budget in June 1983,
when the current population criteria were first applied to results of the 1980 Census.
Adjacency was determined by both physical boundary adjacency and a finding that at least 2
percent of the employed labor force in the nonmetropolitan county commuted to metropolitan
central counties.

```

ER12222  "COMPLETED ED-HD"                   NUM(2.0)
Head's Completed Education Level

Values in the range 1-16 represent the actual grade of school completed; e.g., a value of
8 indicates that the Head completed the eighth grade. A code value of 17 indicates that
the Head completed at least some postgraduate work.

Education is asked only when the FU acquires a new Head. In cases where the Head has
remained the same person from the previous interview (ER11712=5), this variable has been
carried forward from previous years' data with no updating or other change. Education was
asked of all Heads in 1985.

This variable differs from the individual level variable ER33415 in the treatment of Heads

who received a GED but did not attend college. The family-level variable value for such
Heads is the highest grade completed; for the individual-level variable, the value is 12.

ER12223R  "HOUSEHOLD ID#"                    NUM(5.0)

Household ID Number

This variable was generated to simplify the clustering of multiple panel family units
residing in the same households. Its values were assigned simply by selecting a 1997 ID
number (ER10002) with the lowest value from among the 1997 ID numbers (ER10002) of those
families comprising each such household group. This value was used in these file positions
for all of the related households. Thus, if the user sorts the data ordered by this
variable, the family units within larger household groups will be adjacent to each other.
Family units who did not share their households with any other family unit or shared only
with non-panel family units were given their own values for ER7002. The range of values is
1-16970, but the series is not contiguous. See 'Linking Data: Families Sharing Households'
in Section I, Part 5, of the guide to the 1997 family data, 97GUIDE.PDF, for a discussion
of ways to identify shared households in the early years of the PSID.
