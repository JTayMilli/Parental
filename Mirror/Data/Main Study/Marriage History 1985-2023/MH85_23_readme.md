I. Introduction

These files contain data and documentation from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) Marriage History, 1985-2023. This file, MH85_23_readme.pdf, provides
information about the contents of all the files in this package. See the PSID website for a
description of sample SAS and SPSS programs needed to merge the family-year data
with the cross-year individual data to create a traditional cross-year family-individual file
or use the Data Center. It is recommended that one carefully reviews this material before
proceeding with any work using the data files.

A. DATA

There is one data file:

- The 1985-2023 Marriage History File.

The 1985-2023 Marriage History File contains details about persons living in a PSID
family, at the time of the interview, in any wave, from 1985 through 2023, and their
respective spouses.

The data are in raw ASCII form. Refer to one of the associated program files - SAS,
SPSS, or STATA -- for record format layout information, variable names (or numbers),
variable labels (or names), and missing data codes.

B. SAS, SPSS, and STATA

These files contain SAS, SPSS, and STATA statements providing information about the
variables in the data files. The naming conventions are the same as for the data files:
mh85_23.sas contains SAS statements, mh85_23.sps contains SPSS statements, and
mh85_23.do contains equivalent STATA statements.

The statements provide variable names and locations, variable labels, and missing data
codes (note, the STATA file does not contain missing data codes). Not all variables in
the collection have assigned missing data codes. The missing value specifications
provided are consistent with those specified in the codebooks. One should check the
codebook for each variable one is including in oneâ€™s analysis to determine if other codes
should also be defined as missing.

The SAS, SPSS, and STATA statements are NOT intended to represent completed and
full programs for the respective statistical program packages to run extracts, analyses, etc.
One must provide all other package-specific statements needed to complete a program.
