B. SAS, SPSS, and STATA

These files contain SAS, SPSS, and STATA statements providing information about the
variables in the data files. The naming conventions are the same as for the data files:
PREGINT23.sas contains SAS, PREGINT23.sps contains SPSS statements, and
PREGINT23.do contains equivalent STATA statements.

The statements provide variable names and locations, variable labels, and missing data
codes (please note, the STATA file does not contain missing data codes). Not all
variables in the collection have assigned missing data codes. The missing value
specifications provided are consistent with those specified in the codebooks. One should
check the codebook for each variable one is including in oneâ€™s analysis to determine if
other codes should also be defined as missing.

The SAS, SPSS, and STATA statements are NOT intended to represent completed and
full programs for the respective statistical program packages to run extracts, analyses, etc.
One must provide all other package-specific statements needed to complete a program.
