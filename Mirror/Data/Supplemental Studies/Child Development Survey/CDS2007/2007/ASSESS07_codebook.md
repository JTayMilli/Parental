BMIZ07   "Z-SCORE FOR BMI 07"                 NUM(6.2)
Calculated z-score for Body Mass Index.

If preliminary calculation of height z-score or weight z-score was greater than 6.0 or
less than -6.0, then the record was examined for accuracy of the original height or weight
fields (A1/A3A/A3C and/or A2/A4A/A4C). Height and weight outliers were recoded to NA in
the corresponding original field, and the corresponding z-score was reset to NA. BMI was
also set to NA if either height or weight were set to NA. Note that some few outliers
remain for BMI (z-score greater than 6.0), though neither of their corresponding height or
weight values were deemed to be outliers.
