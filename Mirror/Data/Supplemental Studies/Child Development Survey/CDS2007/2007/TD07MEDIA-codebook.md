Determine the format of the television program, video or movie in terms of its technical
mode of presentation.

The television program, video or movie must fit into one of the following three labels

(1~3) or be coded as "Uncodeable (=8)".

```

```
Code Value/Range Text

Live-Action [Features life-like characters and scenery
throughout entire program, video or movie. Includes the
appearances of people, puppets, animatronics, etc. Most
science-fiction and fantasy programs (see SF/F/SP
category) can be coded under this label. Examples:
American Horror Story, American Idol, Modern Family, CSI,
Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Interstellar, Jurassic Park,

Law and Order, How I Met Your Mother, The Matrix, Star

Wars, Lord of the Rings.]

Animation / Cartoon [Completely animated and does not
feature any life-like characters or scenery. Made up of
images generated from drawings, special techniques or
technology. Includes cartoons, claymation, computer
graphics, etc. Examples: Archer, Dora the Explorer,
Finding Nemo, Frozen, Kung Fu Panda, Looney Tunes, Lion
King, Little Mermaid, Minions, Shrek, The Simpsons, South

Park, Toy Story.]

Combination [Uses both live-action and animation. Uses

them either (a) simultaneously; (b) going back and forth;
or (c) both (a) and (b). Usually, the animations are not
intended to pass as life-like or function as live-action
portrayals. It is natural that the viewer is aware and
conscious of the fact that both formats are being used
together. Examples: Sesame Street, Baby Einstein, Space
Jam, Scooby Doo movie.]

Uncodeable [It is impossible to accurately discern the
program's format from the information provided.]

TD07M10  "INTENDED AUDIENCE 07"                NUM(1.0)

Determine the audience that the television program, video or movie is primarily intended

to reach.

Please note that coding for this category aims to capture the 'intended' audience, NOT the

'actual' audience. In other words, although there are television programs, videos and

movies that become popular among unintended audiences, these secondary audiences should

not be considered within this category. For example, the movie Shrek was originally

intended to target children but has contingently become popular among adults as well. In

this case, the appropriate label for this movie is "Children (=1)" [NOT "General (=4)"].

Some telvision programs, videos and movies are intended to appeal to both adolescents and

adults. For example, the movie Spiderman (2002) targets an adolescent audience as well as

an adult audience. In this case, you should code UP in order to capture the older

audience and label it "Adults (=3)" [NOT "Adolescents (=2)"; NOT "General (=4)"].

The television program, video or movie must fit into one of the following four labels

(1~4) or be coded as "Uncodeable (=8)".

TD07M12  "GENRE 07"                      NUM(2.0)

different from one another. Please try to capture the key qualitative characteristic of

the program. The program may have characteristics that pertain to more than one genre.

In such case, determine the PRIMARY goal or focus of the program and code accordingly.

In order to facilitate the process, you may code this category simultaneously with the

Comedy category, for which the descriptions are given in the following section.

Friends. Note: "Daytime Soap Operas" are coded
separately under Code 14. Note: Most programs will
contain elements of "Daily Life/Relationships". If the

then it should be coded as so. However, if you find that
a program equally contains elements of "Daily

TD07M15  "CURRICULUM 07"                    NUM(1.0)

Determine the nature of the curriculum that the television program, video or movie is
intended to provide.

Some programs tend to have multiple curricular goals. In such cases, assess and code for

the PRIMARY goal or focus of the program. For example, Sesame Street teaches lessons to

enhance both children's pro-social values as well as their school readiness skills.

However, the pro-social messages are embedded within lessons that teach school readiness

skills, such as learning shapes and numbers. That is, the school-readiness lessons are

the main focus. In this case, the appropriate label for this program is "School Readiness

(=3)" [NOT "Pro-Social (=2)"].

Also note that we are assessing the 'general, overall' curricular of the program itself.

That is, we are assessing only that curriculum which consistently makes up a major part of

the regular formula of the program. You should NOT focus on 'irregular, occasional

happenings' of one or two specific episodes or scenes.

The television program, video or movie must fit into one of the following six labels (1~6)

or be coded as "Uncodeable (=8)".

TD07M16  "VIOLENCE 07"                     NUM(1.0)

Determine the type of violence that is present in the television program, video or movie.

Please note that coding for this category aims to capture the different 'qualities' or
'types' of violence portrayed in a program/video/movie. The coding labels do NOT

represent a scale of violence ranging from 'least to most' violent. In other words, we

are assessing the 'qualitative' rather than the 'quantitative' aspects of violence within

a program.

Also note that we are assessing the 'general, overall' tone of the program/video/movie

itself. That is, we are assessing only that violence which consistently makes up a major

part of the regular formula of the program. You should NOT focus on 'irregular,

occasional happenings' of one or two specific episodes or scenes. However, within a film,

if the one violent scene is crucial to the development of the narrative and

characterization or makes up the climax of the program, it should be considered.

The television program, video or movie must fit into one of the following seven labels

(1~7) or be coded as "Uncodeable (=8)".

Slapstick / Comedic Violence [Portrayal of harsh
physical stunts, abuse, and/or fighting, but presented in
silly and exaggerated manner for laughs. The comedic

context decreases, or even diminishes, the essential

intensity of the behavior, giving off the impression of
harmlessness. Examples: Three Stooges, The Simpsons, Tom
and Jerry, Road Runner, A Christmas Story, America's
Funniest Home Videos, Lego movies, Madea movies, National
Lampoon movies.]

Sports Violence [Violence that is part of the very
nature of a sports event. Also includes violence that
occurs outside of the actual game but is due to a
happening during the actual game. Injury and damage may
occur most often as a result from harsh physical contact
with another athlete. Includes most contact-sports
programs. Sports depicted in film (ex. Rocky) and
accidents or brawls that occasionally happen during a
sports event are NOT considered under this label.
Examples: boxing, wrestling, rugby, football, hockey,
roller derby, etc. (NOT gymnastics, ice skating,

baseball, basketball, etc.).]

Victimization [Realistic portrayals of undeserved
victimization of crime, such as murder, burglary,
robbing, mugging, kidnapping, child abuse, etc. Includes
crimes against humanity or hate crimes against a specific
gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, etc. Main
story revolves around or is motivated by such crimes;
sometimes, the crime serves as the central impetus to the
storyline. Invokes a "This can happen to me, too!" type
alarm or fear. The actual act of crime can take place on
screen (visible) or off screen (implied). Can be either
fiction or non-fiction. Captures most of those coded as
"Case Solving (=11)" and "News (=2)" under the Genre
coding section. Also includes graphic injuries, deaths,
and physical action due to natural disasters (storms,
tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.) and

non-fictional animals. Includes victimization of animals

by humans. Examples: CSI, Law & Order, Cold Case Files,
2012, Castaway, Breaking Bad, Grey's Anatomy, Sleeping
Beauty, The Color Purple, Pretty Little Liars, news.]

Gratuitous Violence [The actual, physical act of
violence is visually depicted and is a prominent
characteristic; involves a lot of physical action, such
as fighting and killing. Includes depictions of war in
action. Also includes graphic injuries, deaths, and
physical action (flying bodies) due to big explosions and

collisions. A character takes on a violent act as a

means to an end; always has a reason, whether it is
morally right or wrong. Captures many of those coded as
"Action/Adventure (=12)" and "Horror/Thriller (=13)"

under the Genre coding section. Also includes nature
documentaries that depict animals killing prey and
fictional dramas that depict violence inflicted on humans
by fictional creatures/animals, which usually have
artificial human intelligence. Examples: American Horror
Story, The Walking Dead, Pacific Rim, Criminal Minds,
Marvel Avengers movies.]

Ultra Violence [Main characteristic is the repetitive,
"in-your-face" presentation of violence, hostility,
brutality, and the truly evil; violence that does not
have any clear moral or rational aim. Usually, a violent

act is not a means, but an end in itself for the

character and overall narrative. Includes overt and

extensive portrayals of fighting, beating, killing, rape,
and torture, which are usually accompanied with graphic
depiction of blood and body parts. Can be very shocking
and grotesque. Applies more to movies than TV programs.
Examples: The Godfather, Natural Born Killers, Pulp
Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Clockwork Orange, Thirteen

Ghosts, Hannibal.]
