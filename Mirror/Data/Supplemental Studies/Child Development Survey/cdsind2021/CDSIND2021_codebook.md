CDSCUMID68 "1968 INTERVIEW NUMBER"                NUM(4.0)

1968 Interview Number

This variable is the 1968 family ID number. The combination of this variable and Person

Number (CDSCUMPN) provides unique identification for each individual on the data file.

Individuals associated with families from the Latino and Immigrant samples, added to the
PSID in 1990/1992 and 1997/1999, and 2017 respectively, were assigned 1968 IDs so that

they, too, have unique identifiers compatible with the PSID structure for the core (SRC

and Census) sample.
