The next questions ask about the child care arrangements or programs that you have used for
your (CHILD) since (his/her) birth. We want to start with the first arrangement you used for
(CHILD) and then continue through any additional arrangements you may have used, in the order
that you used them. We will end the history when (CHILD) started kindergarten. We will be
using P. 25 of your booklet.


H1. First, how old was (CHILD) when (he/she) was first cared for by someone other than you
(or your spouse) on a regular basis? By regular I mean at least once a week for a month.


H1a. [ASK IF NECESSARY BUT MARK BOX:] Was that before or after (CHILD)
started Kindergarten?
