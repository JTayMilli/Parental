### **Instructions**

##### An important part of our research is to find out how children of all ages spend time during the week and on the weekends. The Diary is a listing of your child’s activities during a weekday and during one weekend day. These diaries will help us collect the most accurate information possible, and your filling them out ahead of time will make the interview go more quickly. The time diary is from the perspective of the child and what the child was doing during a day. • Please fill out the Time Diary for the day of the week specified on the front cover. • Please fill out the Time Diary for the child listed on the front cover. • Please use one line for each activity and write in what your child was doing. • If he/she was watching TV or playing a video or computer game, please write in the name of the program or game. • Please indicate who was doing the activity with the child and who else was in the same location (but not doing the activity with the child). • Please indicate if the child was doing any other activity at the same time. • Please fill out the diary for the entire 24-hour time period, starting with midnight on the specified day and running until midnight on the next day. List the child’s first activity of the day, the child’s second activity of the day, on to the child’s last activity on the day. • On the following page, you will find some examples of these activities and how they would be filled out for this time diary.  The following scenario is only an example of how to fill out a time diary. It may not be at all reflective of a day in the life of your child. Your interviewer will be glad to help you with any questions or problems you may have in completing the diary. Please give this diary to your interviewer at the time of your interview. **Any questions? Call 1-800-759-7947**

**A Day in the Life of an 8 year old child...**


The child’s day begins with the child getting out of bed at 7:30 a.m. and going to the bathroom. As you can see, the mother recorded that her child was “sleeping” between midnight
and 7:30 a.m. and then “getting up” as the primary activity from 7:30 a.m. to 7:40 a.m. Her child did not get out of bed immediately and had to be coaxed into getting out of bed so it
took 10 minutes from the time he woke up to get to the bathroom. From 7:40 a.m. to 7:45 a.m. the child is in the bathroom. For activities such as “using the bathroom,” “sleeping,”
“getting diaper changed,” or other personal care activities, the last 3 columns (columns G, H, and J) of the time diary are not completed. These should be left blank for these activities.


From 7:45 a.m. to 8:15 a.m. the child is eating breakfast and watching T.V. The mother lists this in the time diary as the primary activity “eating breakfast” and the secondary activity,
“watching T.V.” The child is primarily involved in eating breakfast and is only watching T.V. as an activity to do while eating. The child is eating breakfast with the mom, dad, and
cousin who is staying over. So the mother lists this in the time diary as no one directly involved in the activity with the child but then lists her, the father, and the cousin in the next
column as being present but not directly involved in the activity. (Note: If the child had been a baby, then it is possible for one of the parents to be directly involved in the activity of
“eating breakfast”).


For 8:15 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. the child is getting ready for school. Then at 8:45 a.m. the mother drives the child to school. As previously stated, the diary is from the perspective of the
child so the primary activity from 8:15 to 8:45 a.m. is getting dressed and then from 8:45 a.m. to 9:05 a.m. the child is “going to school.” Notice that the primary activity is the travel to
school and the secondary is talking to mother in car. The child is not “driving to school,” that would be the mother’s activity.


The child is in school from 9:05 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. in the afternoon and then goes to the YMCA for an after-school program from 3:15 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. when child is picked up by the
father. The child has told the mother and father a little about school that day and the after-school program and the mother has recorded it according to her knowledge of the child’s
schedule and the time the child reported doing the activity. Once again the ride from the YMCA to the home is recorded as “going home from YMCA.” Also note how other people
involved in the activities are listed.


The child and father arrive at home at 5:30 p.m. and the child begins watching television while the mother prepares dinner. The mother lists the child’s primary activity as “watching
T.V.” and then puts the name of the television program(s) in the space provided. The child is playing with toys while watching television, so playing with toys is listed under the
secondary activity column.


Starting at 6:00 p.m. the child eats dinner until 6:25 p.m. and then reads a book from the library from 6:25 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. The child then brushes teeth, watches T.V., and then
goes to bed at 9:00 p.m. The mother lists that the child is “listening to a bedtime story” from 9:00 p.m. until 9:20 p.m. and then the final activity is “sleeping” from 9:20 p.m. until
midnight.
