**Ages:   CHILDREN 8 YEARS AND OLDER**


**C0.** **INTERVIEWER CHECKPOINT**

|STEP ONE: CHECK LABEL ON FACESHEET. IS CHILD’S AGE 8 YRS OR OLDER?<br>GO TO D1, P. 17<br>1. YES 5. NO|Col2|
|---|---|
|||



**STEP TWO: READ THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS:**


**Example 1:**
(HAND R RESPONDENT BOOKLET) Now, I am going to ask you your opinion about some questions. I want
you to know that there are no right or wrong answers to them, I only want to know what you think. Here is a picture
to use in answering the question I will ask next. For example, if I asked:


(RB, P. 4) How hard is **spelling** for you?


**VERY EASY** **NOT EASY** **VERY HARD**

**OR**

**HARD**


If you think spelling is very easy, you would tell me the number 1.


If you think it is very hard, you would tell me the number 7.


What would you say if it’s not easy or hard?
IF R CHOOSES 4, SAY “Four means not easy or hard.”
IF R DOES NOT CHOOSE 4, SAY “Actually, four means not easy or hard .”


What number would you say if you think it’s a little hard?
IF R CHOOSES 5 OR 6, SAY “(5/6) means a little hard.”
IF R DOES NOT CHOOSE 5 OR 6, SAY “Actually, you would choose 5 or 6 because 4 is not easy or hard, and
7 is very hard, and a little hard is somewhere in between those.”


##### **5**

Let’s try another one,


**Example 2:**
(RB, P. 5) If you were to list all the students in your class from the worst to the best in spelling, where would you
put yourself?


**ONE OF THE** **IN THE** **THE BEST**

**WORST** **MIDDLE**


Imagine how well all the kids in your class do in spelling. If you think you are one of the worst, you would choose
the number 1, the smallest or shortest bar.


If you think you are the best, you would choose the number 7, the largest or highest bar.


What would you circle if you think you are in the middle?
IF R CHOOSES 4, SAY “Four means not one of the worst or one of the best.”
IF R DOES NOT CHOOSE 4, SAY “Actually, you would choose 4.”


How about if you’re between the middle and the best?
IF R CHOOSES 5 OR 6, SAY “(5/6) means between the middle and the best.”
IF R DOES NOT CHOOSE 5 OR 6, SAY “Actually, you would choose 5 or 6.”


Now, I’m going to ask you some questions and you just let me know which number describes how you think or feel.
Remember any answer is fine as long as it’s the way you think or feel!
