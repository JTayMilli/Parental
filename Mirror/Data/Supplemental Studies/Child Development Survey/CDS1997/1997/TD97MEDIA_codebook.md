"Uncodeable (=8)".

```

```
Code Value/Range Text

Live-Action [Features life-like characters and scenery
throughout entire program. Includes the appearances of
people, puppets, animatronics, etc. Most science-fiction
and fantasy programs (see SF/F/SP category) can be coded
under this label. Examples: Mr. Rogers, Friends, Law and
Order, American Idol, Jurassic Park, Star Wars,
Andromeda, Matrix, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings.]

Animation / Cartoon [Completely animated and does not
feature any life-like characters or scenery. Made up of
images generated from drawings, special techniques or
technology. Includes cartoons, claymation, computer
graphics, etc. Examples: Looney Tunes, Lion King, Little
Mermaid, Dora the Explorer, South Park, Simpsons, Barbie
Nutcracker, Wallis and Gromit, Shrek, Toy Story.]

Combination [Uses both live-action and animation. Uses
them either (a) simultaneously; (b) going back and forth;
or (c) both (a) and (b). Usually, the animations are not
intended to pass as life-like or function as live-action
portrayals. It is natural that the viewer is aware and
conscious of the fact that both formats are being used
together. Examples: Sesame Street, Space Jam, Lizzie
McGuire, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Jay Jay the Jet Plane,
Theodore Tugboat, Thomas the Tank Engine, Between the
Lions, Mary Poppins.]

Uncodeable [It is impossible to accurately discern the
program's format from the information provided.]

TD97M10  "INTENDED AUDIENCE"                  NUM(1.0)
Determine the audience that the television program is primarily intended to reach.

Please note that coding for this category aims to capture the 'intended' audience, NOT the
'actual' audience. In other words, although there are programs that become popular among
unintended audiences, these secondary audiences should not be considered within this
category. For example, the movie, Shrek, was originally intended to target children but
have contingently become popular among adults as well. In this case, the appropriate
label for this movie is "Children (=1)" [NOT "General (=4)"].

Some programs are intended to appeal to both adolescents and adults. For example, the
movie, Spiderman (2002) targets an adolescent audience as well as an adult audience. In
this case, you should code UP in order to capture the older audience and label it "Adults
(=3)" [NOT "Adolescents (=2)"; NOT "General (=4)"].

The program must fit into one of the following four labels (1~4) or be coded as
"Uncodeable (=8)".

Children [Aimed specifically at children, from pre-K
through elementary school age. Ways to assess this: toys,
food, or games are marketed based on the program;
commercials that air during the program are child
oriented; programs are originally aired in the mornings
(in particular, Saturdays and Sundays) or in the
afternoons (after school). Examples: Teletubbies,
Sesame Street, Nick Jr. shows, Spongebob Squarepants, Spy
Kids, Looney Tunes, Shrek, Ice Age, Mary-Kate & Ashley
Olsen videos (those produced between 1995~97; all titles
listed in 1997 wave), Care Bears, Monsters Inc.,
Inspector Gadget.]

Adolescents [Designed for an adolescent audience of
middle- and high-school age. Usually depicts situations
that this age group may experience, featuring characters
that are of this age group. Examples: Saved by the Bell,
Lizzie McGuire, The OC, Beverly Hills 90210, Dawson's
Creek, Harry Potter; That's So Raven, Punk'd, Cribs,
Making the Band, sports shows such as Little League,
high-school cheerleading, etc.]

Adults [Consistently contains adult situations or
language including, but not limited to, sexual innuendos
and graphic violence. Dialogue, vocabulary, and plot tend
to be complex. (Targeted to 'your parents' or the 18-34
demographic.) Examples: Law and Order, CSI, Desperate
Housewives, Lost, Swan, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond,
Seinfeld, SNL, Real World, American Idol, NFL, NBA games
(most sports shows), news, award shows,
culture/science/history documentaries.]

General [Consciously designed for all audiences;
intended to appeal to a wide-range of audience.
Appropriate for children to watch but simultaneously fun
for adults to watch as well. The level of violence, sex
or language is usually mild. Often focuses on the
adventures of a family. Usually is a sit-com or drama
format. Examples: Seventh Heaven, Full House, Cosby
Show, Leave it to Beaver, Bernie Mac Show, The Waltons,
Little House on the Prairie, Brady Bunch, Sound of Music,
Free Willie, America's Funniest Home Videos, Annie,
Miracle on 34th St., Jack Frost, Mouse Trap, Honey I
Shrunk..., MLK Parade, nature docus, home videos.]

TD97M11  "CHARACTER AGE"                    NUM(1.0)
Determine the age-range of the characters that the television program consistently
revolves around.

Please note that coding for this category aims to capture the age-range of the 'fictional
characters' that are being portrayed within the program, NOT the age-range of the 'real
actors' who play the characters. Only in the case of non-fictional programs should the
age of the actual personalities be assessed.

Code the program for this category regardless of its format. The age of non-human
characters, such as talking animals and puppets, should also be coded when applicable.

Do NOT consider characters that are peripheral to the overall storyline. For example,
parents can appear in a program that revolves around the children, where the children's
adventures, exploits, and experiences are the primary focus. In this case, the age of the
children should be determined, not the parents'; the appropriate label for this program is
"Children (=2)" [NOT "Cross-Age (=6)"].

Do NOT consider voice-over narrators that are not visible. For example, off-screen
narrators for nature documentaries are not considered to be characters.

The default label for this category is "Cross-Age (=6)". In other words, if a program
features many characters but no salient 'main' character(s), it should be coded as "CrossAge (=6)".

The program must fit into one of the following six labels (1~6) or be coded as "Uncodeable
(=8)".

up over time, equally portraying the characters during
their younger and older years. Examples: Cosby Show,

different from one another. Please try to capture the key qualitative characteristic of
the program. The program may have characteristics that pertain to more than one genre.

TD97M15  "CURRICULUM"                     NUM(1.0)
Determine the nature of the curriculum that the television program is intended to provide.

Some programs tend to have multiple curricular goals. In such cases, assess and code for
the PRIMARY goal or focus of the program. For example, Sesame Street teaches lessons to
enhance both children's pro-social values as well as their school readiness skills.
However, the pro-social messages are embedded within lessons that teach school readiness
skills, such as learning shapes and numbers. That is, the school-readiness lessons are
the main focus. In this case, the appropriate label for this program is "School Readiness
(=3)" [NOT "Pro-Social (=2)"].

Also note that we are assessing the 'general, overall' curricular of the program itself.
That is, we are assessing only that curriculum which consistently makes up a major part of
the regular formula of the program. You should NOT focus on 'irregular, occasional
happenings' of one or two specific episodes or scenes.

The program must fit into one of the following six labels (1~6) or be coded as "Uncodeable
(=8)".

TD97M16  "VIOLENCE"                      NUM(1.0)
Determine the type of violence that is present in the television program.

Please note that coding for this category aims to capture the different 'qualities' or
'types' of violence portrayed in a program. The coding labels do NOT represent a scale of
violence ranging from 'least to most' violent. In other words, we are assessing the
'qualitative' rather than the 'quantitative' aspects of violence within a program.

Also note that we are assessing the 'general, overall' tone of the program itself. That
is, we are assessing only that violence which consistently makes up a major part of the
regular formula of the program. You should NOT focus on 'irregular, occasional
happenings' of one or two specific episodes or scenes. However, within a film, if the one
violent scene is crucial to the development of the narrative and characterization or makes
up the climax of the program, it should be considered.

The program must fit into one of the following seven labels (1~7) or be coded as
"Uncodeable (=8)".

Non-Violent / Non-Hostile [Does not directly show nor
indirectly imply violent/hostile behaviors, attitudes,
etc. Is neutral on violence/hostility, if not friendly.
Examples: Teletubbies, Seventh Heaven, Modern Marvels,
Dawson's Creek, Oprah, American Idol, Newlyweds.]

Slapstick / Comedic Violence [Portrayal of harsh
physical stunts, abuse, and/or fighting, but presented in
silly and exaggerated manner for laughs. The comedic
context decreases, or even diminishes, the essential
intensity of the behavior, giving off the impression of
harmlessness. Examples: Three Stooges, Tom and Jerry,
Road Runner, America's Funniest Home Videos, Monty
Python, National Lampoon series, Carol Burnett Show.]

Sports Violence [Violence that is part of the very
nature of a sports event. Also includes violence that
occurs outside of the actual game but is due to a
happening during the actual game. Injury and damage may
occur most often as a result from harsh physical contact
with another athlete. Includes most contact-sports
programs. Sports depicted in film (ex. Rocky) and
accidents or brawls that occasionally happen during a
sports event are NOT considered under this label.
Examples: boxing, wrestling, rugby, football, hockey,
roller derby, etc. (NOT gymnastics, ice skating,
baseball, basketball, etc.).]

Victimization [Realistic portrayals of undeserved
victimization of crime, such as murder, burglary,
robbing, mugging, kidnapping, child abuse, etc. Includes
crimes against humanity or hate crimes against specific
gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, etc. Main
story revolves around or is motivated by such crimes;
sometimes, the crime serves as the central impetus to the
storyline. Invokes a "This can happen to me, too!" type
alarm or fear. The actual act of crime can take place on
screen (visible) or off screen (implied). Can be either
fiction or non-fiction. Captures most of those coded as
"Case Solving (=11)" and "News (=2)" under the Genre
coding section. Also includes graphic injuries, deaths,
and physical action due to natural disasters (storms,
tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.) and
non-fictional animals. Includes victimization of animals

by humans. Examples: CSI, Law & Order, America's Most
Wanted, Cold Case Files, Panic Room, Ransom, Schindler's
List, The Holocaust, Mississippi Burning, As Good as It

Gratuitous Violence [The actual, physical act of
violence is visually depicted and is a prominent
characteristic; involves a lot of physical action, such
as fighting and killing. Includes depictions of war in
action. Also includes graphic injuries, deaths, and
physical action (flying bodies) due to big explosions and
collisions. A character takes on a violent act as a means

to an end; always has a reason, whether it is morally
right or wrong. Captures many of those coded as
"Action/Adventure (=12)" and "Horror/Thriller (=13)"
under the Genre coding section. Also includes nature
documentaries that depict animals killing prey and
fictional dramas that depict violence inflicted on humans
by fictional creatures/animals, which usually have
artificial human intelligence. Examples: Die Hard,
Lethal Weapon, Rambo, Scream, I Know What You Did Last
Summer, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Band of
Brothers, Deep Blue Sea, King Kong, Godzilla, Jurassic
Park, adult Japanese-anime.]

Ultra Violence [Main characteristic is the repetitive,
"in-your-face" presentation of violence, hostility,
brutality, and the truly evil; violence that does not
have any clear moral or rational aim. Usually, a violent
act is not a means, but an end in itself for the
character and overall narrative. Includes overt and

extensive portrayals of fighting, beating, killing, rape,
and torture, which are usually accompanied with graphic
depiction of blood and body parts. Can be very shocking
and grotesque. Applies more to movies than TV programs.
Examples: Godfather, Natural Born Killers, Pulp Fiction,
Reservoir Dogs, Trainspotting, Clockwork Orange, Bad
Lieutenant, True Romance, The Cook the Thief His Wife &
Her Lover, Seven, Hannibal.]
