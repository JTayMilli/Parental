## **Chapter 1 – An Introduction to TAS**

Over the past several decades, the U.S. and other countries have seen a lengthening of the period
between childhood and adulthood—the “transition into adulthood.” Youth no longer move quickly from
secondary education into the labor force and independent economic living. Based on data from the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), less than 50% of individuals will become a head or
spouse/partner of their own PSID family before they reach their mid-20s.


Scientists are becoming increasingly aware that the period between the ages of 18 and 28 years are
critical for life span development. It is during this period that major investments are made in
education, crucial decisions are made regarding partnering and childbearing, and careers are planned
and initiated. For PSID, this means that important educational and occupational transitions are often
made while young adults are still dependent on their parents, many years before they become family
heads and spouse/partners themselves and officially join the PSID sample as primary respondents.


The “Transition into Adulthood Supplement” (TAS) is part of PSID and a follow-up to the original PSID
Child Development Supplement (CDS). Although PSID collects some information about everyone who is
a co-resident member of each family in the study, considerably more information is collected on the
head and spouse/partner. Without the TAS, this design would result in a large gap in information about
the youth experiences of the 1997 CDS cohort between their last CDS interview in adolescence and
their first interview as a PSID head or spouse/partner. In other words, there would be a major gap in
information about early adulthood transitions. The launching of TAS was motivated by recognition that
these years are marked by choices, changes, and transitions that have profound life-long
consequences, but would be missed by the sample design of the PSID prior to 2005. To bridge this gap,
TAS was initiated in 2005 when the oldest CDS respondents reached 18 to 20 years of age. TAS has
subsequently been conducted in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 when the youngest individuals in the
original CDS will have reached adulthood. In 2017, TAS will be relaunched to capture information on
the transition into adulthood of _all_ young adults in the PSID, not just those who participated in the
original, or ongoing, CDS.


Based on current literature and theories guiding research on the adult transitional years, the TAS
interview was designed to build on the information collected from these children when they
themselves were interviewed as adolescents in CDS-II and CDS-III, and, at the same time, harmonized
and coordinated with data to be collected on them when they are interviewed as adults in future

waves of Core PSID.


To fully understand TAS, one must be familiar with the Core PSID and original CDS data collection
projects. Therefore, a brief description of the design and content of Core PSID and the original CDS is
provided here.


The Panel Study of Income Dynamics is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative sample of
U.S. families. Since 1968, PSID has collected data on family composition changes, housing and food
expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment, income, wealth, time spent in housework,
health, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 75,000 people have ever participated in the
panel, which includes up to five generations within a family. PSID is the longest running panel on
family dynamics, and is considered one of the most important data archives in the world.


5


The PSID now is conducted every other year by telephone with data collection commencing in March
and ending by December of odd-numbered years.


In 1997, PSID supplemented its main survey with collection of additional data on a cohort of 0-12 yearold children in the study and their parents. The objective of this supplement—the Child Development
Supplement—was to provide researchers with a comprehensive, nationally representative, and
longitudinal data base of children and their families with which to study the dynamic process of early
human capital formation. Two additional waves of CDS were conducted in 2002-2003 (CDS-II), when
the children were 5-17 years of age, and in 2007-2008 (CDS-III) for children in the cohort who were
under 18 years of age.


The data collection activities for CDS-I, II, and III were extensive. Within the context of family,
neighborhood, and school environments, CDS gathered information about a broad array of
developmental outcomes including (but not limited to) physical health, emotional well-being, cognitive
abilities, achievement, and social relationships with family and peers. Each CDS child could have up to
eight modules of data collected from three different family members (primary and secondary
caregivers and the target child) and a school information source (teacher and/or school administrative
data).


Because CDS is a supplement to the PSID, the study takes advantage of an extensive amount of family
demographic and economic data about the CDS child’s family, providing more extensive family data
than any other nationally-representative longitudinal survey of children and youth in the U.S.


_**Bridging the Gap**_


Across the three waves of CDS, the study has collected data on children and youth aged 0-18 years.
CDS youth will eventually become the future “active panel” of Core PSID when they move out of (or
“split-off”) from their parents’ home and establish an independent household of their own. Under the
current design of the TAS, CDS youth will participate in TAS data collection until they reach age 28,
regardless of whether they have become members of Core PSID. When they join Core PSID, they will
participate in that study every other year from that point forward.


The Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) thus serves as a “bridge of information” between the
rich data collected in the CDS on the years between birth and age 18 years, and the rich data collected
in the PSID on the years after economic independence is established.

## **Chapter 2 – An Overview of TAS Questionnaire Content**

The TAS questionnaire is separated into 12 sections, each of which represents a specific area of
interview content. A summary of each section is provided below.


_**Section A: Time Use**_


As individuals move from adolescence into adulthood, they are confronted with new choices about how
to use their discretionary time. In addition, the concept of community takes on a broader meaning and
provides opportunities for greater integration into a larger social context. In Section A, we measured
time spent on a selected number of leisure activities, computer/internet use, and community
engagement. Certain items from the CDS were repeated, permitting time-series analysis of activity
patterns in organized arts and sport, TV watching, reading, and computer use. In other sections we
asked about time spent in other activities, as well as time spent with friends, family, and romantic
partners. The questions in this section asked about frequency of participation in these activities during
the past 12 months.


_**Section B: Responsibilities**_


In this brief section, we assessed the level of responsibility that the respondent assumes for living
arrangements and money management including earning their own living, making rent or mortgage
payments, paying their bills, and managing their personal finances. Respondents were asked to rate
their abilities to manage their money and solve day-to-day problems. In addition, information
about living arrangements during a typical school year and during the summer was collected.


_**Section C: Self**_


Section C consists of self-rated levels of skill in areas such as leadership, intelligence, independence,
confidence, and problem solving, as well as self-rated psychosocial measures about worries and
discouragement.


_**Section D: Marriage, Family, and Relationships**_


This section obtained information about the current marital and cohabitation status of the individual

and subjective evaluations of all romantic/intimate relationships through questions about living
arrangements, general satisfaction with relationships, time spent with partner, future expectations of
relationship duration, and the likelihood of marriage and divorce. Information was collected on past,
present, and future childbearing and fertility expectations, gender roles, biological/adopted child
rearing/family values, and parenting skills and experiences. The individual’s relationship with his or
her parents was assessed, continuing the collection of measures from CDS.


Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not asked questions about when they were widowed or when they were
divorced, as these questions were asked in their 2015 Core PSID interview.


_**Section E: Employment**_


This section collected detailed information about current employment status and all types of
employment and money-earning activities for the previous two years. Measures included salary/wages,



7


hours, experience, and size and type of the employer, reasons for being unemployed and/or not
working, as well as the methods and frequencies of job hunting. Moreover, detailed information was
collected about service in any branch of the Armed Services, and self-rated satisfaction with military

service was obtained.


Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; however, those
living on their own were only asked the latter questions pertaining to involvement in the Armed
Services because information about their past and present work status was obtained in their 2015 Core

PSID interview.


_**Sections F and W: Income and Wealth**_


In Section F, we collected information on income earned during the previous calendar year from a
number of other sources, including unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, dividends,
interest, trust funds, child support, and welfare, and gifts. We also asked about financial help
received from parents and other relatives for daily living expenses, as well as larger monetary gifts,

and inheritances.


In section W, a short series of questions that estimated the net value of automobiles, stocks and
bonds, checking and savings accounts, life insurance policies, and any other assets and investments
was asked. Information was also collected about student loans, credit card balances, and other

debts.


Respondents living with their parents or away at college were asked all questions in these sections;
respondents living on their own were only asked the latter questions pertaining to financial help, gifts,
and wealth because their income and business holdings information was gathered in their 2015 Core

PSID interview.


_**Section G: Education and Career Goals**_


A key marker of the transition into adulthood is attainment of post-secondary educational degrees,
which, in turn, feeds into work plans and career aspirations. Some young adults, however, may choose
an alternative route to a traditional college track, such as a military career (see Section E) or
vocational training.


In Section G, we gathered information about the amount, dates, and location of education, starting
with high school completion or GED attainment, high school GPA, and experience with college
entrance exams. We asked if the respondent had ever attended or is currently attending college and, if
not, the reason for not attending.


_**Section H: Health**_


This section began with a self-rated measure of the individual’s overall health and asked if he or she
had, or had ever been diagnosed with, a series of chronic illnesses/conditions such as asthma,
diabetes, hypertension, cancer, any mental health condition, and learning disabilities. For each
condition, we asked age when first diagnosed and limitations on normal daily activities that resulted
from the condition. We then asked a short series of questions about psychological distress during the
past 12 months. These questions are parallel to those asked in the Core PSID instrument.


In young adulthood, individuals begin to take on more responsibility for maintaining their own health.
This task involves both routine visits to the doctor and dentist, maintenance of a healthy body weight,


8


and engagement in a number of lifestyle practices such as exercising, eating balanced meals, and
abstaining from tobacco use, binge drinking, the use of illegal drugs or misuse of prescription
medicines, and unprotected sex. In Section H, we asked about all of these behaviors.


The path through Section H was more complicated than for other sections. Some, but not all, of the
questions in the TAS interview are the same as those in Core PSID. For respondents living on their own
as PSID heads or spouses, we skipped the first part of the section and started with health behaviors to
avoid repeating questions that are collected in the Core PSID interview.


_**Section K: Social Environment**_


Section K included five distinct series of questions addressing everyday discrimination, peer influence,
assault, risky behavior, and encounters with the law.


Day-to-day encounters with discrimination were measured by asking about frequency of experiencing
specific types of discrimination. If one or more situations were endorsed, we asked the perceived
reason for the discriminatory experience.


Peer influence was assessed through a set of questions about characteristics of friends with respect to
school and work-related activities, family and interpersonal relationships, community involvement, and
general outlook or attitudes about the future.


We asked about prior assaults, and the age at which an assault happened.


The items concerning dangerous and risky behaviors included fighting, damaging property, and drunk
driving. We asked how often the respondent engaged in each behavior in the prior six months.
Incidents of arrest, probation, and jail time were measured separately through questions on when
and why the offense(s) occurred.


Respondents living at home, away at college, and living on their own all received the same set of
questions in this section.


_**Section L: Religiosity/Race & Ethnicity**_


In this brief section, we asked about current religious preferences and the importance of religion and
spirituality in the respondent’s life. Two standard race and ethnicity items questions are asked only
of respondents living at home with their parents because those living on their own received these
two questions in their 2015 Core PSID interview. All respondents were then asked about the
importance of their ethnic identity.


_**Section M: Outlook on Life**_


The TAS interview ended with a series of questions tapping into subjective well-being.
Respondents were asked 23 questions which comprehensively assessed adult well-being in terms
of emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Starting in 2013, this section also collects
information on the “big five” personality types: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
neuroticism, and openness to experience. [1]

13


## **–** **Chapter 4 The TAS Sample**

The TAS-2015 sample is defined by four basic components:


1. Age 18-28 years;
2. No longer attending high school;
3. Participated in at least one CDS interview (1997, 2002/2003, or 2007/2008); and
4. Family participated in the 2015 Core PSID interview (either through their own

interview as Head/Spouse/Partner or by identification as an “other family unit
member” in a household interview).


_**Age and High School Attendance**_


All potentially-eligible TAS respondents were identified and screened in the Core PSID interview.
During the TAS interview, respondents were asked to confirm their date of birth and whether they
were attending school (and, if so, what grade they were currently attending). If, during the TAS
interview, the interviewer learned that the respondent was under the age of 18 or that the respondent
was still in high school, the interviewer was instructed to code the respondent as non-sample (age or
grade ineligible).


_**Member in the CDS Cohort**_


All TAS sample members completed a family-level baseline interview in CDS. This means the CDS
primary caregiver had reported information about each TAS sample member. The TAS sample members
may have also participated in an educational assessment and a child interview during CDS, but this
information was not used in determining eligibility for TAS.


A total of 1,887 individuals aged 18-28 participated in at least one CDS interview and were members of
families who completed the 2015 Core PSID interview. These individuals were identified as eligible for
the TAS-2015 survey.


14


## **Chapter 5 – Data Collection Procedures**

This chapter provides an overview of the data collection procedures for TAS-2015.


_**Contacting Respondents**_


The selected respondent was preloaded into a computer-based sample management system. Prenotification letters announcing the study and a respondent booklet were sent to all eligible sample
members. The respondent booklets were not always used—for example, the respondent booklet was
not used if it was unavailable (either had not arrived or was misplaced). If the respondent did not have
the booklet, they had the option of viewing the booklet online if they had access to the internet. If
not, the interviewer read the response options.


Busy schedules, caller ID, cell phones, and gatekeepers were the main obstacles in reaching and
scheduling interviews with these young adults. Interviewers enlisted contact persons (usually parents)
to help determine the best time to reach respondents. In some instances, parents contacted
respondents to let them know to expect a call from the study.


_**Quality Control**_


The Quality Control Plan for TAS-2015 consisted of three components: certification, verification, and
evaluation. Certification, in the form of a practice interview, was completed immediately following
the interviewer training and ensured that all field staff received appropriate training on the TAS-2015
interview instrument and were able to complete the interview professionally and according to the
study protocol. Verification of interview data was conducted via telephone calls to respondents who
were re-asked questions that were included in the original interview so that the responses could be
compared. Evaluation of the interviewers’ adherence to general interviewing techniques and studyspecific protocols was based on the review of recorded interviews by data collection staff.


_**Respondent Payments**_


All respondent payments were handled by project staff using an internal system. Participants were
either paid by check or money order. Each respondent received $60 for the completion of an
interview. There was also a $30 one-time “welcome” incentive for newly eligible respondents and
“welcome back” incentive for returning respondents upon interview completion. If the respondent
expressed concern about their cell phone minutes used, interviewers offered an additional $10
incentive to offset the cost of extra minutes used to complete the interview by cell phone. If a
contact person was used to help find a participant they were offered between $10 and $20.


_**Results of Data Collection Effort**_


The TAS-2015 sample of 1,887 individuals was released to the field for interviewing. Of these, 1,641
provided complete interviews, yielding an 87% response rate for the TAS-2015 fieldwork effort. Table
1 provides the final dispositions for the total sample of 1,887 cases.

## **–** **Chapter 6 The TAS-2015 Sample Weight**

To account for differential probabilities of selection due to the original PSID sample design and subsequent
attrition, the TAS-2015 data are provided with a sample weight. The construction of the TAS-2015 sample
weight is described in this chapter.


_**Sample Transition from CDS-I to TAS-2015**_


The TAS-2015 respondents were all originally selected for CDS-I in 1997 when they were 0–12 years of age.
Of the 3,563 children who participated in the original 1997 CDS-I interview, 2,528 were projected to be
eligible for participation in TAS-2015. For these 2,528 cases, Table 2 summarizes the final contact and
interview dispositions in TAS-2015.


Among the projected eligible sample, which excludes deceased (n=8) and non-sample individuals (n=78), a
total of 1,641 interviews were completed, resulting in a cumulative unweighted response rate of 67.2% (i.e.,
1,641/ (1,641+801) =0.672). [2]

|Table 2: TAS-2015 Sample Disposition|Col2|

_**Methodological Approach**_


Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal probabilities of
sample selection and non-response or data that is missing at random (MAR; Little and Rubin, 2002). [3] These
weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each observation is selected and, conditional on
selection, that individuals respond to the survey questions. With longitudinal data, this joint probability at
time _t_, where the study has started at _t_ -1 or earlier, can be expressed as the following


_P(S_ _t_ _=1)=P(S_ _t-1_ _=1)*P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1),_ _(1)_

where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in the study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at time _t._
Under this quasi-random model of the survey response process, the probability of being a participant at
time _t_ is the product of the probability of participating in the previous period and the conditional

2 The cumulative response rate is defined as a ratio of the number of cases that were successfully interviewed in TAS2015 to the number of cases that were projected to be eligible for TAS-2015 in 1997, excluding deceased and nonsample individuals.

“probability” of responding in the current period. Because the first term on the right-hand side of Equation
_(1)_ is proportional to the reciprocal of the weight in the previous period, the weight in the current period is
a product of the weight in the previous period and the inverse of the probability of response (the second
term on the right hand side of Equation _(1)_ ). We will refer to _1/ P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1)_ as the attrition adjustment
factor.

To reduce variation in response propensity weights and lower the reliance on correct model specification of
the logistic regression, nonresponse adjustment classes are created by grouping the probability of response
(stratification on the propensity score; Little and Rubin, 2002) [3] and then the inverse of the response rate of
each adjustment class is used as the nonresponse adjustment factor for that class. (Kott 2012) [ 4] shows that
estimating the nonresponse adjustment using sample design weights for respondent and nonrespondent
cases provides greater protection against nonresponse bias, therefore the inverse of the TAS-2015 weighted
response rate for eligible cases in each propensity adjustment class is used to derive the nonresponse
weighting factor for the respondent cases in each class.


_**TAS-2015 Individual Weight**_


The TAS-2015 individual weight was designed to account for the differential attrition between the baseline
CDS-I (in 1997) and TAS-2015, i.e. _t=_ 2015 and _t_ -1 _=_ 1997. Thus, the TAS-2015 weight is a product of the CDS-I
weight, i.e., the individual-level primary caregiver/child weight (stored in the weight variable named
‘CH97PRWT’), and the attrition adjustment factor [5] .


To obtain the attrition adjustment classes, the probability that a sample person was nonresponse in TAS2015 was estimated using a logistic regression model. The dependent variable for this nonresponse
propensity model is Y=1 if the eligible sample person was a nonrespondent in 2015 and Y=0 if they were a
respondent (see Table 2). The estimated parameters and standard errors for the logistic model of
nonresponse attrition are reported in Table 3. For example, the results indicate that the odds of attrition
between 1997 and 2015 were significantly higher among male children as compared to female children,
those in Northeast and South regions as compared to the West region, and significantly lower among older
children, black children as compared to non-black children, and those whose head of household was male as
compared to female heads, holding all else equal.

For the TAS-2015 attrition adjustment, 10 nonresponse weighting classes were defined based on deciles of
the predicted probability of CDS-I to TAS-2015 attrition estimated using the logistic model in Table 3. The
inverse of weighted response rate for TAS-2015 eligible sample cases in each decile (with the CDS-I weight
serving as the weighting factor), was assigned as the nonresponse adjustment factor for that weighting
class. The final weight for TAS-2015 respondents was constructed as the product of their CDS-I base weight
and their weighting class nonresponse adjustment factor.

As the final step in weight development, the newly constructed TAS-2015 weight was censored or trimmed
to reduce the influence of extreme weight values on the variances of sample estimates of population
statistics. The cases with the weight values in the top one percent and in the bottom one percent of the
weight distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th] and 1 [st] percentiles of the weight
distribution, respectively. Table 4 reports key summary statistics for the final TAS-2015 individual weight.

To examine the properties of the TAS-2015 weight, we compared weighted estimates for selected
demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in the CDS-I data computed in two ways. The first
set of estimates is based on the full CDS-I sub-sample that remained eligible for TAS-2015. The CDS-I weight
was used to create these estimates for the full TAS-2015 sample. The second set of estimates is based only
on the TAS-2015 respondent cases and employs the TAS-2015 weight that adjusts for longitudinal
nonresponse among the eligible cases in the TAS-2015 wave of data collection. The results are provided in
Table 5 and show that the distributions of the selected characteristics are similar in the appropriatelyweighted TAS-2015 eligible sub-sample of CDS-I and in the TAS-2015 interview sample, suggesting that the
attrition adjustment for the TAS-2015 weight compensates for potential attrition bias for variables included
in the analysis. It is important to note, however, that this comparison does not necessarily rule out the
possibility of selection bias associated with other characteristics of the respondents.

The final TAS-2015 weight is stored in the variable TA151294.

## **Chapter 7 – PSID Data Resource**

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative
sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning over four decades of data collection, contains
over 80,000 variables on a diverse set of topics, including the dynamics of family composition change,
marital and birth histories, housing, income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of family
members, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 75,000 individuals have ever participated in the
panel, which includes up to five generations within a family. PSID is the longest running panel on
family and individual (including child) dynamics and has consistently achieved wave-to-wave
reinterview response rates of over 95 percent. More information about the study and its instruments

can be obtained from its website:


[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx)


The PSID’s online bibliography provides references to studies using the data for many research topics
(key word index provided):

For TAS data users, the rich family data in the core PSID provide a valuable opportunity to explore the
effects of family environmental factors in analyses of child outcomes. For a more comprehensive look

_**PSID Data Center Files**_

Most of the family and individual-level data on all waves of the PSID, CDS, and TAS are housed in the
PSID’s Online Data Center. There are tutorials that provide a guided overview to using the data.
Customized data sets and codebooks can be generated through the easy-to-use Online Data Center:


http://simba.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx


_**Data Files – Individual, Family, CDS, and TAS**_

In the Online Data Center, the data are grouped by PSID main study data and by CDS and TAS data.
Within the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family level files. The
individual level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data. The family-level files include
not only “raw” interview data but also complex generated variables on income, work, wealth, sample
weights, and other measures. Data, by wave of the study, are provided as the next level within each
of the data groupings. In the CDS and TAS data group, the data are clustered by child-level files, which
include all of the interview modules, and by time diary activity files, which are at the activity level.
