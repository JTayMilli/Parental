**I. DATA CHARACTERISTICS**

A. Files and Format

The 2015 Transition to Adulthood (TAS) final release data consists of one data file with 1,641 records and
1,304 variables. Using the web-based Data Center is the most efficient way to obtain the data. At this
time, we also provide the data in a .zip package. If you download the data in ASCII form, from the PSID
website, you will receive SAS, SPSS or STATA statements, as you request. In the .zip package, we
include the entire data file in ASCII format and SAS, SPSS, and STATA data definition statements.
These statements provide variable names, locations, and variable labels.

The definition statement files are not intended to represent complete and full programs for the respective
statistical program packages to run extracts, analysis, etc. You must provide all other statements needed
to complete a program. Missing data statements are not provided as part of the files.

B. Documentation and Codes

1. Transition to Adulthood User Guide

For an overview of the 2015 questionnaire changes, a description of our generated and hand-coded
variables, please see the TAS User Manual: Release 2015.1, located on our website at
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/documents.aspx.](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/documents.aspx)

2. 2015 Questionnaire

Box-and-arrow questionnaires are available for all waves in PDF format. Use the SAS, SPSS, and
STATA data definition statements to match variables with questions in the CAI application.

3. Codebook and Code Categories

The Data Center allows users to create and download customized codebooks that provide variablespecific documentation. Variable descriptions are complete for all of the 2015 TAS data items. The
downloadable .zip package of the data on our website contains a .pdf version of the entire TAS codebook
for 2015.

In general, codes follow our traditional schema, although "don't know" responses are now largely
distinguished from other missing data responses. Generally, code 8 (or 98 or 998, etc.) represents "don't
know" and code 9 (or 99 or 999, etc.) represents other missing data or a refusal. Inappropriate questions
(e.g., those that do not apply) are padded with zeroes.

C. Missing Data

For Release 2 of the 2015 Transition to Adulthood File we have added fields for G8_5A (TA150719A and
TA150719B).
