## **Chapter 1 – An Introduction to TAS**

_**1.1 Background**_
Over the past several decades, the United States and other countries have seen a lengthening of the
period between childhood and adulthood—the “transition into adulthood.” Youth no longer move
quickly from secondary education into the labor force and independent economic living. Based on data
from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), less than 50% of individuals will form their own
independent family unit before they reach their mid-20s.


Scientists are becoming increasingly aware that the period between age 18 and 28 years are critical
for life span development. It is during this period that major investments are made in education,
crucial decisions are made regarding partnering and childbearing, and careers are planned and
initiated. For PSID, this means that important educational and occupational transitions are often
made while young adults are still dependent on their parents and are not primary respondents

themselves.

The Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) was launched in 2005 to follow sample members from
the original Child Development Supplement (CDS) cohort into young adulthood. The first six biennial
waves of TAS, from 2005 to 2015, focused exclusively on interviewing members of the original CDS
cohort as they passed through young adulthood. TAS was relaunched in 2017 with a new steady state
design and now follows all Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) sample members who are entering
early adulthood, and who comprise the future focal sample members of Core PSID. Information is
collected on many domains including psychological functioning, family formation, fertility-related
behavior, cohabitation, childhood adversity, computer skills, responsibilities, employment and income,
education and career goals, and health. TAS enables a variety of research designs to study the wellbeing of young adults over historical and developmental time in family, school, and neighborhood

context.

_**1.2 The Original CDS and TAS Cohorts**_
The original Child Development Supplement began in 1997 as a cohort study. Children born between
1984 and 1997 who were aged 0 to 12 years in 1997 were eligible for CDS-1997. Up to two age-eligible
children per family were selected to participate. In 2002, a second wave of the original CDS collected
data on sample members when they were aged 5 to 17 years. In 2007, the third and final wave of the
original CDS was conducted with children aged 10 to 17 years.

The oldest members of the original CDS cohort had entered adulthood by 2003 and were ineligible for
CDS-2007. Instead, they were included in the earliest waves of the original Transition into Adulthood
Supplement. The original TAS began in 2005 to follow original CDS participants as they entered
adulthood. The first wave included 745 participants who were aged 18 to 20 years. Each subsequent
wave included interviews with previous respondents and added original CDS participants who had
entered adulthood in the preceding two years. By 2013, the original TAS included respondents who
were between 18 and 28 years old.


_**1.3 Ongoing CDS and TAS**_
All members of the original CDS cohort had entered adulthood by 2014. In that year, children in active
PSID families who were born since 1997 were invited to participate in a new, ongoing Child
Development Supplement. In contrast to the original CDS cohort, the new, ongoing CDS included all



7


children aged 0 to 17 years. Under the ongoing CDS design, children under age 18 years will be invited
to participate in a CDS interview about every five years. Sample children who have been born or
moved into a CDS family since the last wave of CDS are also eligible to participate.

Since 2017, TAS has also switched to a new, steady-state design. The ongoing Transition into Adulthood
Supplement now includes all eligible young adults aged 18 to 28 years in active PSID families regardless
of whether they had participated in the original or ongoing CDS. This new design adds young adults
who were eligible, but not selected, for the original CDS cohort; nonrespondent children from the
original CDS or the ongoing CDS; and young adults whose families joined PSID after 1997, including
families recruited as part of the 2017 PSID new immigrant refresher sample.

_**1.4 TAS-2019**_

TAS in 2019 followed closely the content and design of the previous wave in 2017. However, one major
innovation was the implementation of a mixed-mode design in which a randomly selected 80 percent
of the TAS sample was offered the option of completing their interview by web with a telephone
interview option available to respondents who did not or could not complete their interview by web.
The remaining 20 percent of the TAS sample was assigned to the telephone mode and were not
provided the option of a web interview. This design allows data users to examine, and implement
corrections where necessary, potential mode differences in interview responses.

_**1.5 Core PSID**_

CDS and TAS are embedded in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the world’s longest-running
nationally representative household panel survey. Since 1968, PSID has collected data on family
composition changes, housing and food expenditures, marriage and fertility histories, employment,
income, wealth, time spent in housework, health, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 82,000
people have ever participated in the panel, which includes up to seven generations within a family.
PSID is considered one of the most important longitudinal and intergenerational studies in the world.

PSID was conducted annually between 1968 and 1997 and biennially since 1999. PSID has collected data
on individuals and families that emphasize the dynamic and interactive aspects of family economics,
demography, and health. When paired with CDS and TAS, the design and content of PSID enable
research on the intergenerational influence of family on child and young adult outcomes and on how
childhood and young adulthood shape later health and well-being.

TAS thus serves as a “bridge of information” between the in depth data collected in the CDS on the
years between birth and age 18 years, and the rich data collected in the PSID on the years after
economic independence is established.

## **Chapter 2 – An Overview of TAS Questionnaire Content**

The TAS-2019 questionnaire comprises 10 sections, each of which represents a specific area of interview
content. A summary of each section is provided below.

_**Section A: Community Engagement and Technology Use**_
Questions in Section A focus on involvement over the last 12 months in the community including
volunteering and community service, group organizations, and sports participation, as well as the type of
organization and frequency of participation. A question series on technology use asks about the access
and ownership of cell phones, computers, tablets, and the internet. Frequency and type of technological

use is also collected.

Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not reasked questions that were asked in their 2019 Core PSID interview.

_**Section B: Family Relationships, Personality, and Mental Health**_
Section B assesses the individual’s relationship with his or her parents. Respondents were also asked a
series of questions assessing emotional, psychological, and social well-being. These series include the
‘Big 5’ personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism),
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) on depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)
assessment. Questions also include self-rated levels of skill in areas such as leadership, intelligence,
independence, confidence, and problem solving, as well as self-rated worries and discouragement.

The level of responsibility that the respondent assumes for living arrangements and money
management including earning their own living, making rent or mortgage payments, paying their
bills, and managing their personal finances is also assessed. Respondents were asked to rate their
abilities to manage their money and solve day-to-day problems. Information about living
arrangements during a typical school year and during the summer was also collected.

Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not reasked questions that were asked in their 2019 Core PSID interview.

_**Section C: Interpersonal Relationships**_

This section obtains information about the current marital and cohabitation status of the individual

and subjective evaluations of all romantic/intimate relationships through questions about living
arrangements, general satisfaction with relationships, time spent with partner, future expectations of
relationship duration, and the likelihood of marriage and divorce. Information was collected on past,
present, and future childbearing and fertility expectations, gender roles, biological/adopted child
rearing/family values, and parenting skills and experiences. Questions regarding gender identity and

sexual orientation are also asked in this section.

Respondents living at home or away at college were asked all questions in this section; respondents
living on their own were not reasked questions from their 2019 Core PSID interview about when they
were widowed or when they were divorced.


9


_**Section D: Employment, Military Service, and Time Use**_
Section D collected detailed information about current employment status and all types of
employment and money-earning activities for the previous two years. Measures included salary/wages,
hours, experience, and size and type of the employer, reasons for being unemployed and/or not
working, as well as the methods and frequencies of job hunting. Moreover, detailed information was
collected about service in any branch of the Armed Services, along with self-rated satisfaction with
military service.

Information about how individuals spent their time during the past 12 months was collected including
time spent on leisure activities, computer/internet use, and community engagement. Certain items
from the CDS Primary Caregiver Child file were asked, permitting time-series analysis of activity
patterns in organized arts and sport, TV watching, reading, and computer use.

_**Section E: Past Year Income and Financial Help**_
Information was collected on income earned during the previous calendar year from multiple
sources, including unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, dividends, interest, trust
funds, child support, welfare, as well as financial help received from parents and other relatives for
daily living expenses, larger monetary gifts, and inheritances.

Respondents living with their parents or away at college are asked all questions in these sections;
respondents living on their own were only asked the latter questions pertaining to financial help, gifts,
and wealth because their income and business holdings information was gathered in their 2019 Core

PSID interview.

_**Section F: Wealth**_

A series of questions estimating the net value of automobiles, stocks and bonds, checking and
savings accounts, life insurance policies, and any other assets and investments were asked.
Information was also collected about student loans, credit card balances, and other debts.


_**Section G: Education**_

A key marker of the transition into adulthood is attainment of post-secondary educational degrees,
which, in turn, feed into work plans and career aspirations. In Section G, information was gathered
about the amount, dates, and location of education, starting with high school completion or GED
attainment, high school GPA, and experience with college entrance exams. Respondents were asked if
they had ever attended or are currently attending college and, if not, the reason for not attending.

_**Section H: Health**_

Section H includes a measure of self-rated overall health and whether respondents have ever been
diagnosed with a series of chronic illnesses/conditions such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension,
cancer, any mental health condition, and learning disabilities. The section includes a short series of
questions about psychological distress (K-6) during the past 30 days. These questions are also asked in

the Core PSID instrument.

In Section H, questions were asked about routine visits to the doctor and dentist, maintenance of a
healthy body weight, and engagement in a number of lifestyle practices such as exercising, eating
balanced meals, tobacco use, binge drinking, the use of illegal drugs or misuse of prescription
medicines, and unprotected sex.


10


For TAS respondents who were also a PSID Reference Person or Spouse/Partner, the first part of the
section was skipped and the section started with questions about health behaviors to avoid repeating

items that were collected in the Core PSID interview.

There is no Section I in the TAS-2019 Questionnaire.

_**Section K: Discrimination, Peer Influence, Risky Behavior**_
Section K includes questions addressing everyday discrimination, peer influence, assault, risky
behavior, and encounters with the law. Day-to-day encounters with discrimination are measured by
asking about frequency of experiencing specific types of discrimination. If any experience was
endorsed as happening more than once a year, the perceived reason for the discriminatory experience

was asked.


Peer influence was assessed using a set of questions about characteristics of friends with respect to
school and work-related activities, community involvement, and general outlook and attitudes about the
future. The frequency of engaging in dangerous and risky behaviors over the prior six months was
assessed, included fighting, damaging property, and drunk driving. Incidents of arrest, probation, and
jail time were measured separately through questions on when and why the offense(s) occurred.
Respondents were also asked about prior assaults, and the age at which an assault happened.

_**Section L: Religious and Spiritual Beliefs; Race and Ethnicity**_
Section L assesses current religious preferences and the importance of religion and spirituality in the
respondent’s life. Information was collected on race, ethnicity, and ancestry.


11


## **Chapter 3 – TAS Interview: New and Modified Content**

This chapter describes the new and modified content collected in the TAS-2019 instrument. New or
modified interview content was included in all sections. Because TAS-2019 was a fully mixed mode
instrument (telephone and web), some content was revised for self-administration on the web. A brief
description of these changes is below, with a full inventory of new and deleted items in Appendix A.

_**Section A: Community Engagement and Technology Use**_
Questions A23A-A23G on technology use were reformatted and items in A24 were restructured to be
collected on the web.


_**Section B: Family Relationships, Personality, and Mental Health**_
Three new question series were added in Section B. First, the ‘Big 5’ personality traits on
extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are included in
questions B19A-B19Q. Questions B20A-B20J include the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
which gathers information on depression. Questions B23A-B23G cover the Generalized Anxiety
Disorder (GAD-7) to measure generalized anxiety.

_**Section C: Interpersonal Relationships**_
Questions C14 and C15 were added in the 2019 instrument to collect information on sexual orientation
and current gender identity, respectively.

_**Section D: Employment, Military Service, and Time Use**_
Section D added new levels of specificity to the existing questions on starting and ending employment. In
addition to previously collected month and year of job start and end, day has been added to the
sequence. Questions D10A-D10E collect the number of days, weeks, or months of time away from work
including time taken due to someone else being sick, self being sick, vacation or time off, strike, and
temporary layoff.

The section on military service was updated to add questions D95A-D96 about current military contracts,
re-enlistment, and reasoning for leaving the military, if applicable.

_**Section E: Past Year Income and Financial Help**_
Questions E3J1-E3J10 were added to pick up details on additional jobs that were not reported in the E3
question series. These details include occupation, industry, employer name, start and end dates, and
reasons why employment ended.

_**Section F: Wealth**_

In Section F, bracketed amounts were offered in 2019 to obtain a more accurate value of these types of
student loan debt for those were not able to report an exact value. Questions F38-F51 were added to
collect this information about state student loans, private student loans, and other student loans.


_**Section G: Education**_

Questions were revised and items were restructured for self-administration of the online instrument, but
no new content was added to this section.

_**Section H: Health**_

Section H questions were reprogrammed to be collected on the web, as well as to streamline existing
content. The section contains an array for physical conditions with 17 condition blocks and an array for


12


psychological conditions with 17 condition blocks. This question list format replaces the event history
calendar (EHC) approach used in 2017.

_**Section K: Discrimination, Peer Influence, Risky Behavior**_
Questions K10A-K10B replaced question K10 from TAS-2017, gathering information about arrests
in two separate questions: whether an individual was ever arrested, and if so, how many times.
This same two-question approach was also employed in asking about probation (K16A-K16B) and
jail (K22A-K22B).

_**Section L: Religious and Spiritual Beliefs, Race and Ethnicity**_
Questions were revised and items were restructured to be collected on the web, but no new content was
added to this section.


13


## **–** **Chapter 4 The TAS Sample**

Sample eligibility for TAS-2019 was defined by three criteria:

1. Born between 1991 and 2001. This meant that, in 2019, all eligible sample members were

between ages 18 and 28 years;
2. Family participated in the 2019 Core PSID interview (either through their own interview as

Reference Person or Spouse/Partner or by identification as an “other family unit member”
in a household interview); and
3. Member of the PSID Sample, meaning that they are a lineal descendent (by birth or

adoption) of individuals who were living in an original PSID family unit from 1968 or a new
immigrant refresher family unit from 1997 or 2017. For members of the 2017 new
immigrant refresher sample, an additional TAS-2019 sample eligibility requirement was
that their family completed a 2017 Core PSID interview.

_**4.1 Age Requirements**_
All eligible TAS respondents were identified and screened in the Core PSID interview. During the TAS
interview, respondents were asked to confirm their date of birth. If, during the TAS interview, it was
learned that the respondent was under age 18 years or over age 28 years, the respondent was coded
as non-sample (age ineligible).

_**4.2 Sample Size**_
A total of 3,019 PSID sample members aged 18-28 years were members of families who completed the
2019 Core PSID interview. These individuals were eligible for TAS-2019 and 2,595 completed a TAS2019 interview. Table 1 shows the distribution of the TAS-2019 sample, based on their participation in
the Original CDS, Ongoing CDS, or neither. Table 2 displays the TAS sample by year of collection,
including the ages of the individuals interviewed, the total sample sizes of each wave, and the
response rates over time.

## **Chapter 5 – Data Collection Procedures**

This chapter provides an overview of the data collection procedures for TAS-2019. In 2019, 3,019 ageeligible young adults were contacted for TAS following the completion of the Core PSID 2019 interview.

Data collection occurred over approximately ten months between November 2019 and September 2020.
Respondents were contacted initially by an advance notification letter sent via postal mail, followed by
email and SMS text message requests throughout the field period to complete their interview.

At the end of the field period there were 2,595 completed interviews at an overall response rate of 86%
(see Table 3). The average interview length was approximately 69 minutes, with about 42% of completed
interviews provided by PSID respondents who also provided an interview in Core 2019, 47% by adult
children who reside at home with PSID respondents, and 11% by adult children living at college or
university. Respondents were provided a post-paid incentive of $70 for completing the interview.

|93|Some household member contacted, but eligible respondent not available to do<br>interview; appointment broken, but no evidence of deliberately avoiding interview|
|-|Sample individual resided outside of US or in a remote area and uncontactable<br>(e.g., no telephone)|
|-|Office error – study ended, insufficient or inappropriate calls made, no mention of refusal|
|3|Sample individual unable to participate due to a language barrier|
|15|Sample individual was initially designated be ineligible because their follow status was set<br>to non-followable. However, subsequently determined to be eligible after the interviewing<br>period had ended.|
|54|Interview started but incomplete, no evidence of resistance|

## **–** **Chapter 6 The TAS-2019 Sample Weights**

This chapter provides a description of the sample weights for TAS-2019. There are four weights for TAS2019, one cross-sectional weight and three longitudinal weights. The cross-sectional weight accounts for
unequal selection probabilities due to the PSID sample design, while the longitudinal weights are panel
weights for any TAS Respondent who was interviewed in (1) the original CDS cohort, (2) the original CDS
cohort or CDS-2014, or (3) the original CDS cohort, CDS-2014, or TAS-2017.

_**6.1 TAS-2019 Cross-Sectional Weight**_
The TAS-2019 cross-sectional weight has not been finalized yet. We recommend that data users instead
use the PSID-2019 main interview individual cross-sectional weight in its place.

_**6.2 TAS-2019 Longitudinal Weights**_
For TAS-2019 panel respondents who participated in CDS or the previous TAS wave in 2017, we provide a
longitudinal weight. This weight accounts for differential probabilities of selection due to the original
PSID sample design and subsequent attrition since initial selection. There are three TAS-2019 longitudinal
weights: (1) for original CDS-1997 respondents; (2) for CDS-1997 or CDS-2014 participants; and (3) for
participants from either CDS-1997, CDS-2014, or TAS-2017.

The construction of this TAS-2019 longitudinal weight is described in the remainder of this section.

_**6.2.1 Sample Transition from CDS-1997 to TAS-2019**_
Many of the TAS-2019 respondents were originally selected for CDS-1997 when they were age 2–12 years.
Of the 3,563 children who participated in the original CDS-1997 interview, 2,017 were projected to be
eligible for participation in TAS-2019. For these 2,017 cases, Table 1 summarizes the final contact and
interview dispositions in TAS-2019.

Among the projected eligible sample, which excludes deceased (n=21) and non-sample individuals (n=66),
a total of 1,061 interviews were completed, resulting in a cumulative unweighted response rate of 55.0%
(i.e., 1,061/(1,061+869) =0.550). [1] See Chapter 5 for a description of the TAS-2019 wave-specific response
rate (86%) and data collection procedures and outcomes.

|Table 1: TAS-2019 Sample Disposition from CDS-1997 eligible cases|Col2|

1 The cumulative response rate is defined as a ratio of the number of cases that were successfully
interviewed in TAS-2019 to the number of cases that were projected to be eligible for TAS-2019 in 1997,
excluding deceased and non-sample individuals.

_**6.2.2 Sample Transition from CDS-1997 and CDS-2014 to TAS-2019**_
Most of the TAS-2019 respondents were originally selected for CDS-1997 or CDS-2014 when they were age
2–12 years in each respective survey. Of the 7,442 children who participated in either CDS-1997 or CDS2014, 2,915 were projected to be eligible for participation in TAS-2019. For these 2,915 cases, Table 2
summarizes the final contact and interview dispositions in TAS-2019.

Among the projected eligible sample, which excludes deceased (n=27) and non-sample individuals (n=66),
a total of 1,798 interviews were completed, resulting in a cumulative unweighted response rate of 63.7%
(i.e., 1,798/(1,798+1,024) =0.637).

_**6.2.3 Methodological Approach**_
Sample survey data are typically provided with weights designed to compensate for unequal probabilities
of sample selection and non-response or data that is missing at random (MAR; Little and Rubin, 2002). [2]
These weights are inversely proportional to the probability that each observation is selected and,
conditional on selection, that individuals respond to the survey questions. With longitudinal data, this
joint probability at time _t_, where the study has started at _t_ -1 or earlier, can be expressed as the
following


_P(S_ _t_ _=1)=P(S_ _t-1_ _=1)*P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-1_ _=1),_ _(1)_

where _S_ _t_ is an indicator of participation in the study at time _t_ and _R_ _t_ is an indicator of response at time _t._
Under this quasi-random model of the survey response process, the probability of being a participant at
time _t_ is the product of the probability of participating in the previous period and the conditional
“probability” of responding in the current period. Because the first term on the right-hand side of
Equation _(1)_ is proportional to the reciprocal of the weight in the previous period, the weight in the
current period is a product of the weight in the previous period and the inverse of the probability of
response (the second term on the right hand side of Equation _(1)_ ). We will refer to _1/ P(R_ _t_ _=1|S_ _t-_

_1_ _[=1) ]_ [as the attrition adjustment factor. ]

To reduce variation in response propensity weights and lower the reliance on correct model specification
of the logistic regression, nonresponse adjustment classes are created by grouping the probability of
response (propensity score stratification; Little and Rubin, 2002) [2] and then the inverse of the mean

Sons, New York.

predicted probability of response of each adjustment class is used as the nonresponse adjustment factor

for that class.

_**6.2.4 TAS-2019 Individual Longitudinal Weight for original CDS-1997 participants**_
The TAS-2019 individual longitudinal weight for original CDS-1997 participants was designed to account
for the differential attrition between the baseline CDS-1997 and TAS-2019, i.e. t=2019 and t-1=1997.
Thus, the TAS-2019 longitudinal weight is a product of the CDS-1997 child weight (stored in the weight
variable named ‘CH97PRWT’) and the attrition adjustment factor.

To obtain the attrition adjustment classes, the probability that a sample person was nonresponse in TAS2019 was estimated using a logistic regression model. The dependent variable for this nonresponse
propensity model is Y=1 if the eligible sample person was a nonrespondent in 2019 and Y=0 if they were a
respondent (see Table 1). The estimated parameters and standard errors for the logistic model of
nonresponse attrition are reported in Table 3 and summary statistics for the covariates are reported in
Table 4. The results in Table 3 indicate, for example, that the odds of attrition between 1997 and 2019
were significantly higher among male children as compared to female children, for older children, and for
those living in the Northeast and South regions as compared to the West region, holding all else equal.

For the TAS-2019 attrition adjustment for original CDS-1997 participants, ten nonresponse weighting
classes were defined based on deciles of the predicted response propensity [3] of CDS-1997 to TAS-2019


3 The predicted response propensity is calculated as the complement of the predicted nonresponse
propensity resulted from the logistic model in Table 3. That is, predicted response propensity = (1predicted nonresponse propensity).

attrition estimated using the logistic model in Table 3. The inverse of the mean predicted response
propensity for TAS-2019 eligible sample cases in each decile was assigned as the nonresponse adjustment
factor for that weighting class. The final longitudinal weight for TAS-2019 respondents who were original
CDS-1997 participants was constructed as the product of their CDS-1997 base weight and their weighting
class nonresponse adjustment factor.

As the final step in weight development, the newly constructed TAS-2019 longitudinal weight was
trimmed to reduce the influence of extreme weight values on the variances of sample estimates of
population statistics. The cases with the weight values in the top one percent and in the bottom one
percent of the weight distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th] and 1 [st] percentiles of
the weight distribution, respectively. Table 5 reports key summary statistics for the final TAS-2019
longitudinal weight for original CDS-1997 participants.

To examine the properties of the TAS-2019 longitudinal weight for CDS-1997 participants, we compared
weighted estimates for selected demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in the CDS-1997
data computed in two ways. The first set of estimates is based on the full CDS-1997 sub-sample that
remained eligible for TAS-2019. The CDS-1997 weight was used to create these estimates for the full TAS2019 sample. The second set of estimates is based only on the TAS-2019 respondent cases and employs
the TAS-2019 longitudinal weight that adjusts for longitudinal nonresponse among the eligible cases in the
TAS-2019 wave of data collection. The results are provided in Table 6 and show that the distributions of
the selected characteristics are similar across the two groups, suggesting that the attrition adjustment
for the TAS-2019 weight compensates for potential attrition bias for variables included in the analysis. It
is important to note, however, that this comparison does not necessarily rule out the possibility of
selection bias associated with other characteristics of the respondents.

_**6.2.5 TAS-2019 Individual Longitudinal Weight for CDS-1997 and CDS-2014 participants**_
The TAS-2019 individual longitudinal weight for CDS-1997 and CDS-2014 participants was designed to
account for the differential attrition between the baselines CDS-1997/CDS-2014 and TAS-2019, i.e. t =
2019 and t-1 = (1997, 2014). Thus, the TAS-2019 longitudinal weight is a product of a base weight,
composed by stacking CDS-1997 child weight (stored in the weight variable named ‘CH97PRWT’) and CDS2014 child weight (stored in the weight variable named ‘X14CHWGT’), and the attrition adjustment
factor. The CDS-2014 child weight was re-scaled by a factor of 1,000 to be on the same scale of the CDS1997 child weight.


21


To obtain the attrition adjustment classes, the probability that a sample person was nonresponse in TAS2019 was estimated using a logistic regression model. The dependent variable for this nonresponse
propensity model is Y=1 if the eligible sample person was a nonrespondent in 2019 and Y=0 if they were a
respondent (see Table 2). The estimated parameters and standard errors for the logistic model of
nonresponse attrition are reported in Table 7.

For the TAS-2019 attrition adjustment for CDS-1997 and CDS-2014 participants, ten nonresponse
weighting classes were defined based on deciles of the predicted response propensity [4] of CDS-1997/CDS2014 to TAS-2019 attrition estimated using the logistic model in Table 7. The inverse of the mean
predicted response propensity for TAS-2019 eligible sample cases in each decile was assigned as the
nonresponse adjustment factor for that weighting class. The final longitudinal weight for TAS-2019
respondents who were original CDS-1997 or CDS-2014 participants was constructed as the product of their
respective base weight and their weighting class nonresponse adjustment factor.

As the final step in weight development, this TAS-2019 longitudinal weight was trimmed to reduce the
influence of extreme weight values on the variances of sample estimates of population statistics. The
cases with the weight values in the top one percent and in the bottom one percent of the weight
distribution were assigned values corresponding to the 99 [th] and 1 [st] percentiles of the weight distribution,
respectively. Table 8 reports key summary statistics for the final TAS-2019 longitudinal weight for CDS1997 and CDS-2014 participants.

|Table 8: Summary Statistics for the TAS-2019 Longitudinal<br>Sample Weights for CDS-1997 or CDS-2014 participants|Col2|

|N|1,798|

To examine the properties of the TAS-2019 longitudinal weight for CDS-1997 and CDS-2014 participants,
we compared weighted estimates for selected demographic, geographic, and socio-economic variables in
the CDS-1997/CDS-2014 data computed in two ways. The first set of estimates is based on the full CDS1997 and CDS-2014 sub-sample that remained eligible for TAS-2019. The corresponding weight for each
CDS cohort was used to create these estimates for the full TAS-2019 sample. The second set of estimates
is based only on the TAS-2019 respondent cases and employs the TAS-2019 longitudinal weight for CDS1997 and CDS-2014 participants that adjusts for longitudinal nonresponse among the eligible cases in the
TAS-2019 wave of data collection. The results are provided in Table 9 and show that the distributions of
the selected characteristics are similar across the two groups, suggesting that the attrition adjustment
for the TAS-2019 weight compensates for potential attrition bias for variables included in the analysis. It
is important to note, however, that this comparison does not necessarily rule out the possibility of
selection bias associated with other characteristics of the respondents.


4 The predicted response propensity is calculated as the complement of the predicted nonresponse
propensity resulted from the logistic model in Table 7. That is, predicted response propensity = (1predicted nonresponse propensity).

## **Chapter 7 – PSID Data Resource**

The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative
sample of U.S. families. The PSID data archive, spanning over five decades of data collection, contains
over 95,000 variables on a diverse set of topics, including the dynamics of family composition change,
marital and birth histories, housing, income, wealth, welfare participation, health status of family
members, expenditures, philanthropy, and more. Over 82,000 individuals have ever participated in the
panel, which includes up to seven generations within a family.

PSID is the longest running panel on family and individual (including child) dynamics and has achieved
wave-to-wave reinterview response rates of 93-95 percent in recent waves. More information about
the study and its instruments can be obtained from its website:


[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx)


The PSID’s online bibliography provides references to studies using the data for many research topics
(including a keyword index):

[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/Search.aspx](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Publications/Bibliography/Search.aspx)


For TAS data users, the rich family data in the core PSID provide a valuable opportunity to explore the
effects of family environmental factors in analyses of young adult outcomes. For a more comprehensive
look at the PSID, please see the 2019 PSID User Guide:

_**7.1 PSID and CDS-TAS Data Center Files**_

Most of the family and individual-level data from all waves of the PSID, CDS, and TAS are available
[through PSID’s Online Data Center. There are tutorials](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/VideoTutorial.aspx) that provide a guided overview to using the
data. Customized data sets and codebooks can be generated through the easy-to-use PSID Online
[Data Center: https://simba.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx. For data users interested primarily or solely](https://simba.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx)
[in data from TAS and CDS, a separate CDS-TAS Online Data Center is available: http://cds-tas.org/.](http://cds-tas.org/)

_**7.2 Data Files – Individual, Family, CDS, and TAS**_
In the PSID Online Data Center, data are grouped by PSID main study data and by CDS and TAS data.
Within the PSID data group, the data are clustered by individual-level files and family-level files. The
individual-level files include both wave-specific and time-invariant data. The family-level files include
not only “raw” interview data but also complex generated variables on income, work, wealth, sample
weights, and other measures. Data, by wave of the study, are provided as the next level within each of
the data groupings. In the CDS and TAS data group, the data are clustered by child-level files, which
include all of the interview modules, and by time diary activity files, which are at the activity level.
