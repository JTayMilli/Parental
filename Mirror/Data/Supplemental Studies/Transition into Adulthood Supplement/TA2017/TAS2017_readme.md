_**Release 2 Notes:**_ _We have added a third sampling weight â€“ TA171989 - that was not available at the_
_time of release 1. Also, values of 0 pregnancies at TA170170 have been recoded to 97 to help distinguish_
_between those who have 0 pregnancies and respondents who correctly skipped the question._

**I. DATA CHARACTERISTICS**

A. Files and Format

The 2017 Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) final release data consists of one data file with
2,526 records and 2,003 variables. Using the web-based Data Center is the most efficient way to obtain
the data. At this time, we also provide the data in a .zip package. If you download the data in ASCII form
from the PSID website, you will receive SAS, SPSS or STATA statements, as you request. In the .zip
package, we include the entire data file in ASCII format and SAS, SPSS, and STATA data definition
statements. These statements provide variable names, locations, and variable labels.

The definition statement files are not intended to represent complete and full programs for the respective
statistical program packages to run extracts, analysis, etc. You must provide all other statements needed
to complete a program. Missing data statements are not provided as part of the files.

B. Documentation and Codes

1. Transition into Adulthood Supplement User Guide

For an overview of the 2017 questionnaire changes, a description of our generated and hand-coded
variables, please see the TAS-2017 User Manual: Release 2017.1, located on our website at
[http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/documents.aspx.](http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Guide/documents.aspx)

2. 2017 Questionnaire

Box-and-arrow questionnaires are available for all waves in PDF format. Use the SAS, SPSS, and
STATA data definition statements to match variables with questions in the CAI application.

3. Codebook and Code Categories

The Data Center allows users to create and download customized codebooks that provide variablespecific documentation. Variable descriptions are complete for all of the TAS-2017 data items. The
downloadable .zip package of the data on our website contains a .pdf version of the entire TAS codebook
for 2017.

In general, codes follow our traditional schema, although "don't know" responses are now largely
distinguished from other missing data responses. Generally, code 8 (or 98 or 998, etc.) represents "don't
know" and code 9 (or 99 or 999, etc.) represents other missing data or a refusal. Inappropriate questions
(e.g., those that do not apply) are padded with zeroes.
